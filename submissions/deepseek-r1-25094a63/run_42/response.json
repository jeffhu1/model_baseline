        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially the first one. The input lists are being transformed into output lists where some sequences of numbers are replaced with 4s. Let's compare the input and output for Example 0.\n\nTake the third input list in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nNoticing that the sequence starting at index 4 (values 8,8,8,8,8,8) becomes six 4s. Similarly, the sequence of 2s starting at index 20 (seven 2s) becomes seven 4s. So it looks like consecutive numbers of length 6 or more are replaced with 4s. Wait, in that first case, six 8s become six 4s. In the second part, seven 2s become seven 4s. So the rule might be that any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at the fourth input list in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the 8s from index 4-9 (6 elements) become 4s. Then the 2s from index 20-26 (7 elements) become 4s. So again, replacing runs of 6+ with 4s. Wait, but the last part of the output has a 2. Wait, in the output, the original input had eight 2s starting at index 20 (input positions 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2). The output for those positions is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, that's seven 4s and a 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Let me check again. Oh wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the input and output again.\n\nOriginal input list:\nPositions 20-27 (indices 20 to 27 inclusive) in the input are [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] (eight 2s). The output for those positions is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. Wait, that's seven 4s and a 2. That breaks the pattern. Hmm. So maybe the rule isn't exactly runs of 6 or more. Because here, eight 2s would be replaced with seven 4s and a 2? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the indices.\n\nWait the input list for the fourth example is: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]. The output is [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]. So starting at index 20 (original input index 20 is the first 2 in the sequence), the input has eight 2s (positions 20-27 inclusive). But in the output, positions 20-26 are 4s (7 elements) and position 27 is 2. That's strange. So the first seven 2s are replaced with 4s, and the eighth remains. So maybe the rule is to replace runs of exactly 6 or 7? Or perhaps the replacement is only for runs of exactly 6 or more, but how?\n\nWait in the third example of example 0, the output for the 8s (six in a row) becomes six 4s. Then the next part, seven 2s become seven 4s. But in the fourth example, eight 2s become seven 4s and a 2. That's inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at the fifth input in example 0:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\nOutput: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s starting at index 4 (positions 4-9) which become six 4s. Then the next part: starting at index 20 (input has 2s from 20-27: 8 elements). The output shows seven 4s followed by a 3. Wait, the output is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3. So again, seven 4s for eight 2s? That's not matching. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that any run of exactly 6 or 7 elements is replaced by 4s of the same length, but longer runs are partially replaced. Or maybe the replacement is for runs of 6 or more, but only the first 6 or 7 elements. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait in the fourth example's input, the run of 8 2s is replaced with seven 4s and the eighth remains. So perhaps if a run is longer than 7, only the first 7 are replaced? Or maybe there's a maximum of 7 replacements. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that the first occurrence of a run of 6 or more is replaced, and subsequent runs are not? But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait let's check another example. In example 1, let's look at the third input line:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nWait here, the input has 9 consecutive 6s starting at index 5. The output replaces all 9 with 4s. So that's 9 4s. So this contradicts the previous example where a run of 8 was replaced with 7 4s. Hmm. So maybe the initial thought was wrong.\n\nWait in example 1's third input, the 6s start at index 5 and go to index 13 (since 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6). That's nine 6s. The output has nine 4s. So the entire run is replaced. So why in the previous example, the 8 2s were replaced with 7 4s and a 2?\n\nWait maybe I miscalculated the indices. Let me check again the fourth input in example 0:\n\nOriginal input list:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe output is:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nIn the input, the first run of 8s is from index 4 to 9 (6 elements) which are replaced with 4s. Then the next run of 2s starts at index 20 (input index 20) and has 8 elements (indices 20-27). The output for these positions is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. So the first seven 2s are replaced, and the eighth remains. That's confusing. So why seven?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that runs of exactly 7 elements are replaced with 4s. Wait but in the first case, 6 elements were replaced. Or maybe runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s, but only up to 7. So if a run is 6 or 7, replace all. If longer than 7, replace the first 7 and leave the rest. But in example 1's third input, the 9 6s were all replaced with 4s, which contradicts that.\n\nHmm. This is getting confusing. Let's look for another example. Let's check the 8th input in example 0. The input is:\n\n[3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\n\nOutput is the same as input. So no changes here. So maybe there are no runs of 6+ in this input. Let's check: the run lengths here. The longest runs are maybe 1s or others. For example, at position 23-24: 1,1. So only two. So no replacement. So the output is same as input.\n\nAnother example: in example 0's output, the 13th input:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nThe input has a run of 3s starting at index 22 (positions 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3) which is six 3s. The output replaces them with four 4s and then a 3. Wait no. Let me count again. Output positions 22-27: 4,4,4,4,4,3. So five 4s and then a 3. But the original run is six 3s. So that's five replaced and one left. Hmm. This doesn't fit the previous patterns. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or 7, but when the run is exactly 6, replace all 6. If the run is longer than 6, replace the first 6. Wait in the example with eight 2s, the output replaced seven 4s. That's more than 6. So that doesn't fit. Maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but only the first occurrence of such a run in each list. Let's check. For example, in the third input of example 0, there are two runs: one of six 8s and another of seven 2s. Both are replaced. So first occurrence and second occurrence. So that's not the case.\n\nWait maybe the rule is to replace any run of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers with a run of 4s of the same length. But in some examples, like the fourth input in example 0, there's a run of 8 2s but the output replaces seven of them. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is that runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s, but only if they are in certain positions. That seems unlikely as a general pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think differently. Looking at the outputs, the 4s appear in positions where there are consecutive numbers. But why 4? Maybe the number 4 is the sum or something. But 8s and 2s are being replaced by 4. 8+2 is 10, which doesn't help. Maybe the average? 8 is replaced by 4, but 8/2 is 4. So perhaps replacing numbers in a run of 6 or more with half the number, rounded down. But 8 becomes 4, 2 becomes 1, but in the examples, the 2s are replaced with 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 is a placeholder for any consecutive run. So the actual number is replaced with 4 if the run is 6 or longer.\n\nWait in the third input of example 0, the 8s (6 in a row) become 4s. The 2s (7 in a row) become 4s. So any run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nThen in the fourth input of example 0, the 8s (6) become 4s, and the 2s (8) become 4s. Wait, but in the output, the 2s are replaced with seven 4s and one 2. Wait that doesn't fit. Unless there's a mistake in my observation.\n\nWait let me recheck. Original input of fourth example in example 0:\n\nOriginal input (fourth list):\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe output for this list is:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nThe run of 8s in positions 4-9 (6 elements) becomes 4s. Then the run of 2s in positions 20-27 (8 elements) becomes seven 4s and a 2. Wait, but why? If the rule is to replace any run of 6+ with 4s of the same length, then this run of 8 2s should become eight 4s, but in the output, it's seven 4s and one 2. That's a discrepancy. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to split the run into the maximum possible number of 4s. Like, the first 6 elements of the run become 4s, and the remaining stay. But in the case of a run of 8, 6 become 4s and 2 remain. But in the example, it's seven 4s. So that's not fitting.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another angle. Looking at the output lists, the 4s appear in sequences where the input had consecutive same numbers. Let's check the positions in the first example of example 0:\n\nFirst input list in example 0: output is same as input. So no 4s. Because there are no runs of 6 or more? Let's check. Input: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]. Let's look for consecutive duplicates:\n\n- First two 3s: run of 2.\n- Then three 8s (positions 6-8).\n- Then five 3s (positions 10-14). That's a run of 5, which is less than 6. So no replacement. Hence, output is same as input.\n\nSecond input list: same as output. Let's check if there are any runs of 6+. The input is [8,2,1,6,3,1,8,3,1,8,3,8,8,1,3,2,8,3,8,8,3,1,3,1,8,3,2,6,2,6]. The longest run is two 8s. So no replacement. Hence output is same.\n\nThird input list in example 0: the first run of six 8s (positions 4-9) becomes six 4s. Then the run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) becomes seven 4s. So that fits the rule: any run of 6 or more same numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nFourth input list: run of 6 8s becomes six 4s. Then run of eight 2s becomes seven 4s and one 2. Wait, why? That contradicts the previous rule. Unless there's a mistake in observation.\n\nWait let me recount the fourth input list's 2s. The input has:\n\nAt positions 20-27 (indices 20 to 27 inclusive): [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] (eight 2s). The output for these positions is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. So seven 4s and one 2. Why?\n\nThis is confusing. So perhaps there's another condition. Let's check other examples to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's third input:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the input has a run of nine 6s starting at index 5. The output replaces all nine with 4s. So that's consistent with the initial rule. But why in example 0's fourth input, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and one 2 remains?\n\nWait perhaps the runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s, but only if they are in certain positions in the list. For example, perhaps only the first run of 6+ in each list is replaced. But in example 0's third input, there are two runs replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for all runs of 6 or more, but the replacement is done in a certain way. Let's consider that maybe the replacement starts after the first element. Wait no. Alternatively, perhaps the first occurrence of a run of 6+ is replaced, but others are not. But in example 0's third input, both runs are replaced. \n\nWait maybe there's a mistake in the observation. Let me re-examine the fourth input in example 0. The input is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo the run of 8s (positions 4-9) is six in length, replaced with six 4s. The run of 2s is at positions 20-27: eight elements. The output for these positions is seven 4s followed by a 2. So why seven? \n\nWait maybe the run of 2s is actually seven in length, and the eighth element is not part of the run. Let me check the input again. The elements after position 27 (index 27) is 2, then 1, 3. So from index 20 to 27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). So the entire run is eight. So why is the output seven 4s and one 2?\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe there's a different rule here. Perhaps the replacement is done for runs of exactly 6 or 7 elements, and longer runs are split into multiple runs. But why would that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for the first 6 elements of any run of 6 or more. For example, a run of 8 elements would be replaced by 6 4s, leaving the remaining 2. But in example 0's fourth input, the run of 8 2s becomes seven 4s. That's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but the replacement is done by the number 4 repeated (run_length -1) times. So for a run of 6, replace with 5 4s. No, but in example 0's third input, a run of 6 becomes 6 4s.\n\nWait this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the positions where 4s appear. For example, in example 0's third input, the 8s are at positions 4-9 (6 elements) and replaced with 4s. Then the 2s are at positions 20-26 (7 elements) replaced with 4s. But in the fourth input, the 2s are at 20-27 (8 elements), replaced with 7 4s and a 2. So perhaps the replacement is applied for the first 7 elements of a run of 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace all runs of 6 or more with 4s of the same length. But in that case, the fourth example's 8 2s should become 8 4s. But the output is 7 4s and a 2. That's a contradiction. \n\nWait maybe there's an error in the data, or perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recheck:\n\nFourth input list (example 0) input: positions 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). Output: positions 20-27: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. So the last 2 remains. Why?\n\nWait perhaps the rule is to replace runs of exactly 6 or 7 with 4s. If a run is longer than 7, only replace the first 7 elements. So for a run of 8, replace first 7 with 4s and leave the eighth. That would explain this case. Then, for a run of 9, like in example 1's third input, replace all nine with 4s. But that doesn't fit. Because in that case, the run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. So this theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of 6 or more, but with a maximum of seven replacements. So any run of 6 or more becomes seven 4s. But in example 0's third input, the six 8s become six 4s. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is that the run of 6 or more is replaced with 4s starting from the second element of the run. For example, the first element remains, and the next five are replaced with 4s. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, in example 0's third input, the run of six 8s becomes six 4s. So all elements are replaced. If the rule is to replace all elements in a run of 6 or more with 4s, then the fourth input's 8 2s should become eight 4s. But the output shows seven 4s and one 2. So this is inconsistent. \n\nIs there a possibility that the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but only if the number is even? Let's see. In the third input of example 0, 8 is even and 2 is even. Both are replaced. In the fourth input, 8 is even (replaced), and 2 is even (partially replaced). But in example 1's third input, the 6s are even and replaced. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more where the number is even. But in example 0's third input, the 8s and 2s are even. Fourth input, 8s and 2s are even. In example 1's third input, 6 is even. So maybe that's a pattern. But then why in the fourth input's 2s, only seven are replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for even numbers with runs of 6 or more, and for odd numbers, but perhaps there's a different rule. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for all runs of 6 or more, regardless of the number. But the fourth input's 2s have a run of 8, which should all be replaced, but only seven are. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the observation. Let me check the fourth input's output again. Input has eight 2s. Output has seven 4s and one 2. So maybe the run is split into two parts. For example, the first seven 2s form a run of seven, replaced with 4s, and the eighth 2 is a single element. But why would that happen? Because the original run is eight in a row. So why split into seven and one?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the training example. Or maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the other examples to see if this happens elsewhere.\n\nLooking at example 1's third input again: nine 6s replaced with nine 4s. So that's all replaced. So why in example 0's fourth input, eight 2s are partially replaced?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but in the fourth example's case, there's another run earlier in the list that is being considered. For example, perhaps the replacement is applied to the first run of 6+ and subsequent runs are not. But in example 0's third input, there are two runs replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done only for runs of even numbers. But example 1's third input's 6s are even and replaced. The fourth example's 2s are even. But why only seven replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but the number must be a multiple of 4. 8 is 8, which is multiple of 4. 2 is not. So why the 2s are replaced. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, and the number being replaced is divided by 2. 8 becomes 4 (8/2), 2 becomes 1, but in the output, it's 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the numbers in the run is replaced with 4s. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Let me try to look for another approach. Perhaps the 4s are replacing the entire run only if it's in a certain position in the list. Like the middle part of the list. But the examples have runs at various positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more in the entire input, not per list. But the input is a list of lists, and each list is processed independently. So each list is transformed on its own.\n\nLet's consider the first example in the test input. One of the test input lists is:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The last part of this list has 1s from position 21-26 (six 1s). So this run of six 1s would be replaced with six 4s. So the output for this list would have 4s there.\n\nAnother test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, positions 21-27 (seven 1s) would be replaced with 4s.\n\nSo applying the rule: in each list, replace any run of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers with 4s of the same length. So for runs of 6, 7, 8, etc., replace each element in the run with a 4.\n\nBut why in example 0's fourth input, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and a 2? Unless there's a mistake in the data or my observation. Let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal input of fourth example in example 0:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nAh, I see now. The run of 2s in the input is from index 20 to 27 (positions 20 to 27 inclusive). That's eight elements. The output replaces the first seven 2s (positions 20-26) with 4s and leaves the eighth 2 (position 27) as is. So why seven?\n\nWait, maybe the run is split into two parts. For example, maybe there's a break in the run. Let me check the input again. The run is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. All are consecutive. So eight in a row. Why would only seven be replaced?\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps there's a different rule. Maybe the replacement is only for the first occurrence of a run of 6 or more in each list, and subsequent runs are not replaced. But in example 0's third input, there are two runs replaced. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of even length. Six is even, seven is odd. But in example 0's third input, a run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but the length of the replacement is the floor of the run length divided by 2. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. But given the majority of the examples where runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s of the same length, I'll proceed with that rule, even though there's a discrepancy in one example. Maybe that's a mistake or an exception that's part of the pattern.\n\nSo the pattern is: In each list, replace any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nApplying this to the test input. For each list in the test input, look for runs of 6 or more same numbers and replace each element in the run with a 4.\n\nNow, let's look at the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The run of three 3s at positions 2-4 is only 3. The rest are shorter. So no replacements. Output is same as input.\n\nSecond test input list:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nRuns: two 6s, two 8s, two 3s, two 8s, etc. No runs of 6+. So output same.\n\nThird test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, positions 21-26 (six 1s): this is a run of six. Replace with six 4s. So the output for this list would have 4s there.\n\nFourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The run of 1s from positions 20-26 (seven 1s). So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nRun of 8s from positions 4-15: 8,6, then eight 8s? Wait wait, let me check:\n\nThe fifth list is: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nWait the elements after the 6 at position 5 are 8, followed by 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15 inclusive: ten 8s). So that's a run of ten 8s. Replace all with 4s.\n\nThe run of 1s from positions 20-26 (seven 1s) would also be replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the output for this list would have the ten 8s replaced with ten 4s, and the seven 1s replaced with seven 4s.\n\nContinuing this process for each test input list. For each list, check for runs of 6 or more and replace with 4s of the same length."
