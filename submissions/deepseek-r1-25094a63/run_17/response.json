        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output arrays. The first thing I notice is that in the outputs, there are sequences of the number 4 replacing some parts of the input. Let me compare the input and output for the first example.\n\nTake Example 0's first input array:\n[3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\nAnd the output is the same. So no changes here. Then the second input is also the same in the output. But starting from the third input array in Example 0:\n\nInput third array:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput becomes:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nSo here, a sequence of 8s and 2s is replaced by 4s. Let me check how many elements are replaced. The original input has 6 consecutive 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9). In the output, they become six 4s. Then later, starting at position 20, there are seven 2s in the input, which become seven 4s in the output. So it looks like sequences of the same number longer than a certain length are replaced by 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at the fourth input array in Example 0:\nInput:\n[1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\nOutput:\n[1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\nAgain, the six 8s become six 4s, and seven 2s become seven 4s. So perhaps any run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s. Wait, in the third example's input, there's a run of 6 8s (indices 4-9) replaced by 4s. The same in the fourth example. But in the next example, like the fifth input in Example 0:\nInput:\n[3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\nOutput:\n[3, 3, 8, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6, 2]\nSo here, the 8s from position 4-9 (6 elements) are replaced, and the 2s from 20-27 (8 elements) become 4s. So the pattern is that whenever there's a consecutive sequence of the same number with length 6 or more, it's replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's check another example to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third input array:\nInput:\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput:\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nThe input has 9 consecutive 6s (indices 5-13), which are replaced by 9 4s. So the rule is: any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s, with the same length as the original run. If the run is less than 6, it stays the same.\n\nNow, let's look at the test input and apply this pattern. Each array in the test input needs to be processed by replacing any consecutive sequences of 6 or more same numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three 3s \u2192 no\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two 8s \u2192 no\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three 1s \u2192 no\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two 2s \u2192 no\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo sequences of 6 or more, so this array remains unchanged.\n\nNext test array:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs. Let's see:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two \u2192 no\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two \u2192 no\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two \u2192 no\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three \u2192 no\n- 2: single\n\nNo runs of 6, so this array remains the same.\n\nThird test array:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check the 1s. Starting at index 20 (assuming 0-based), we have 2, then 1,1,1,1,1,1 (positions 21 to 26) \u2192 six 1s. So this run of 6 1s should be replaced by six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 4s from index 21 to 26. So the original part [1,1,1,1,1,1] becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4].\n\nFourth test array:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 1s starting at index 20 (positions 20-26): seven 1s. So this should be replaced by seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nCheck for runs. The 8s starting at index 6 (positions 6-15): let's count. From position 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15 inclusive is 10 elements). So a run of 10 8s. Replace with 10 4s. Then, after that, there's a run of seven 1s at positions 19-25 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1). So replace those with 4s.\n\nSo this array would have two sections replaced. The first 10 8s become 4s, and the seven 1s become 4s.\n\nContinuing this process for each test array, replacing any consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers with 4s of the same length. Let's apply this step by step to all test arrays."
