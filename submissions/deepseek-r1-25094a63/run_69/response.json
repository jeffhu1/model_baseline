        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is that we have these input lists, and the output lists are modified versions of them. Looking at the training examples, I need to see what changes between the input and output.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input is a list of numbers, and the output seems similar but with some numbers replaced by 4s. Let me check specific positions. For instance, in the third line of input in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nSo here, starting from index 4 (the fifth element), there's a run of six 8s in the input, and in the output, they're all replaced by 4s. Then, later in the same list, starting at index 20 (the 21st element), there are seven 2s, replaced by seven 4s. Wait, but the output shows four 4s there. Wait, no\u2014looking at the output, from index 20 to 26, it's four 4s each time. Wait, maybe I need to count the exact positions. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input part: positions 4-9 (6 elements) are 8s. Output replaces them with six 4s. Then positions 20-26 (7 elements) of 2s become 7 4s. But the output shows four 4s here. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's index properly.\n\nOriginal input line 2 (third input list) from the first example:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nSo positions 4-9 (six elements) become 4s. Then positions 20-26 (seven elements) of 2s become 4s. Wait, but the output shows from 20: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (seven 4s). So the input had seven 2s here, and all are replaced by 4s. So the pattern here might be that consecutive runs of the same number (maybe with a certain length?) are replaced by 4s. But how long is the run? Let's check the input in this case: the first run is 6 8s, replaced by 4s. The next run is seven 2s, replaced by seven 4s. So maybe runs of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nIn the third line of input in Example 1:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the run of nine 6s starting at position 5 is replaced by nine 4s. Then, the next run of two 6s (positions 17 and 18?) remains as 6s. So that supports the idea that runs of 6 or more are replaced. Let's check another case.\n\nIn Example 0, the fourth input list:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s starting at position 4, replaced by six 4s. Then, seven 2s starting at position 20, replaced by seven 4s. Then, the last two 2s at positions 26-27 (but output shows a 2 at position 27). Wait, perhaps the run is of seven 2s in the input. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for that line: positions 20-26 (7 elements) are 2s. So replaced by seven 4s. Then position 27 is a 2 in the input (so the next element after the seven 2s is another 2?), but in the output, it's replaced with 2. Wait, no. Let me count again. The input is:\n\n[..., 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nSo starting from index 20 (assuming the list is 0-based?), the elements are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Wait, that's eight 2s. But the output shows:\n\n[..., 8, 3, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nWait, so the first seven 2s (positions 20-26) are replaced with 4s, and the eighth 2 (position 27) remains as 2? That would be inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly 6, but the example shows runs longer than 6 being replaced. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's clarify. In the input list, after the 8s, the 2s start at position 20. Let's count the input elements:\n\nOriginal input (fourth list in Example 0):\n\nPositions 0-3: 1,2,8,1\n\nPositions 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s)\n\nThen positions 10-19: 3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3\n\nThen positions 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s)\n\nThen positions 28-29: 1,3\n\nIn the output, positions 4-9 become 4s (six 4s), and positions 20-26 (seven 2s) become seven 4s, then position 27 (another 2) becomes 2? Wait, the output shows positions 20-26 as 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (seven 4s), and position 27 is 2. So the original eight 2s were split into seven 4s and one 2. That suggests that only runs of exactly seven or more are replaced? But in the first example, a run of six 8s was replaced. Hmm, maybe the rule is that any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced by 4s. But in this case, a run of eight 2s is being split into seven 4s and a remaining 2. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the rule is that the first run of six or more consecutive numbers in the list is replaced, but maybe multiple runs are replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, replace each occurrence in that run with 4. Let's check the first example. The third input list (as mentioned before) had two runs: six 8s and seven 2s. Both were replaced by 4s. So that would fit. Then in the fourth input list, the run of six 8s is replaced, and the run of eight 2s is replaced as a single run of eight 4s. Wait, but in the output for the fourth input list, positions 20-27 (eight 2s in input) are replaced by seven 4s and a 2. Wait, that's conflicting. Unless maybe the run is split into two parts. For example, if after replacing the first six elements of a run, the next elements are part of a new run. Wait, but that's not possible because they are the same number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to all consecutive runs of exactly six. Wait, but in the third input list of Example 0, the seven 2s were replaced by seven 4s. So perhaps runs of six or more are replaced. Let's check the eighth input list in Example 0. Let's see:\n\nInput line 8 (from Example 0's input):\n\n[3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\n\nOutput is the same as input. So there's no run of six or more here. That makes sense. Similarly, in the next input line (line 9), no runs of six, so output is same.\n\nIn Example 0, line 12:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nOutput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nHere, the run of six 3s starting at position 22 (elements 22-27) becomes five 4s. Wait, original input from 22: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). Output replaces them with 4,4,4,4,4,4 (six 4s). Wait, but in the output provided, positions 22-27 in the output are 4,4,4,4,4,4. But the output in the example shows:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nWait, the elements at positions 22-27 in the output are 4,4,4,4,4,4 (six 4s), which matches the six 3s in the input. So that fits the pattern. So runs of exactly six are replaced. But earlier examples had runs longer than six replaced entirely. So perhaps all runs of six or more, regardless of length, are replaced with 4s. For example, a run of seven would become seven 4s, a run of six becomes six 4s. Let's confirm.\n\nIn Example 1's first input line:\n\nInput: [6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2]\n\nOutput is same as input. Because there's a run of four 8s (positions 4-7). Then a run of two 6s (positions 8-9). So no runs of six. So output is same.\n\nAnother example in Example 1: line 2.\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, positions 5-13 (nine 6s) are replaced by 4s. So nine 4s. So any run of 6 or more is replaced entirely by 4s. So the rule is: in the input list, any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 6 or longer in length is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each consecutive run of identical numbers, if the length is >=6, replace each element in the run with 4. Otherwise, leave them as they are.\n\nSo the transformation is to replace every run of six or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLet's take the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nCheck for runs of 6 or more. Let's scan through:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three 3s (no)\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two 8s\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three 1s\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two 2s\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single.\n\nNo runs of six here. So the output is same as input.\n\nNext test input list:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two 6s\n- 8,8: two 8s\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two 3s\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two 8s\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two 1s\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two 8s\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three 8s\n- 2: single.\n\nNo runs of six, so output same.\n\nThird test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 3: single\n- 2: single\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1: six 1s. This is a run of six. So replace these six 1s with six 4s.\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 6: single.\n\nSo the output for this list would have 4s replacing the six 1s.\n\nFourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2,2,2: three 2s\n- 1: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1: two 1s\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1: seven 1s.

The first run is four 3s (no replacement). Then there's a 8, then a 3. Then the next part is 8, followed by eight 8s (positions 6-14: eight 8s?), which is a run of nine 8s? Let me count:\n\nThe list is:\n\n3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3.\n\nSo from position 6 to 15 (assuming 0-based), the elements are eight 8s. Wait, position 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:8. That's ten 8s. Wait, original list: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. So positions 6-15 are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s). So run of 10, replaced by 10 4s. Then later, positions 23-28 are 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), replaced by 6 4s.\n\nSo the output for this list would have the ten 8s replaced by ten 4s and the six 8s replaced by six 4s.\n\nNext test list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 3,3: two 3s\n- 1: single\n- 3: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8: eleven 8s.
