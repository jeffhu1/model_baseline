        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list where some of the numbers are replaced with 4s. Let's see when that happens.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input and output are mostly the same, but some sequences of numbers are replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third input line of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nSo the original input had a run of six 8s starting at position 4, and then later a run of seven 2s starting at position 20. The output replaces those runs with 4s. But how many 4s? The first run of six 8s becomes six 4s, and the seven 2s become seven 4s. Wait, but the output for the third input's 20th position starts with 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (seven 4s). So it's replacing runs of the same number (probably longer than a certain length) with 4s of the same length.\n\nLooking at another example. Let's take Example 1. The third input line is:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, there's a run of nine 6s starting at index 5, replaced by nine 4s. So the pattern seems to be: whenever there's a consecutive run of the same number that is 5 or more in length, replace each element in that run with 4. Wait, let's check the first example again. The run of 8s in Example 0's third input is six in length, so replaced. The run of 2s is seven, so replaced. In Example 1's third input, the run is nine 6s. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 5 or longer is replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's verify with other parts of the examples.\n\nLooking at the first two lines of Example 0's input and output. The first input line doesn't have any runs longer than 3 (like three 3s or three 8s), so no 4s in the output. The second input line of Example 0 has some shorter runs, like 8,8 at the start but that's only two, so no replacement. So the threshold must be runs of 5 or more. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at the sixth line in Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [8, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8]\n\nOutput: [8, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 8]\n\nHere, there's a run of six 8s (positions 4-9), replaced by six 4s. Then, a run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) replaced by seven 4s. The last 2 is not part of a long enough run. So the rule seems consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Each line in the test input is a list of numbers. The task is to replace any consecutive runs of the same number that are 5 or longer with 4s of the same length. Let's process each line of the test input.\n\nTake the third line of the test input:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 5 or more. The sequence from index 20 to 25 (inclusive) is six 1s. So those should become 4s. So starting at position 20 (0-based index 20?), the six 1s become six 4s.\n\nAnother example in the test input: the fifth line is:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The part starting at position 5 (assuming 0-based), the 8s from index 5 to 14 (since it's 8,6, then 8,8,... up to index 15 maybe? Wait let's count. The input line is:\n\nIndices 0:6, 1:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8, etc. So from index 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15 inclusive). That's 10 consecutive 8s. So these should be replaced with 4s. So positions 6-15 become ten 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in the same line, after that, there's a run of five 1s at positions 22-26 (assuming the 1s start at index 22). Let me check the input line again. After the 8s, there's 1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6, etc. The 1s starting at position 20 (1-based?) or 19? Let's count:\n\nAfter the 8s at positions 6-15, the next elements are 1,1 (positions 16-17?), then 3,1 (18-19), 6 (20), then 1,1,1,1,1 (positions 21-25). That's five 1s. So that's a run of five, which should be replaced by five 4s. Then later, there's a 6, then 2,8,3.\n\nSo in the output for this line, the 10 8s become 10 4s, and the five 1s become five 4s.\n\nSo applying this to all lines in the test input. Each time there's a consecutive run of 5 or more same numbers, replace each with 4. Let's process each line of the test input one by one.\n\nFor example, the first test input line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's see:\n\n- 6,8,3,3,3: three 3s. Not enough.\n- Then 8, then 1,8,3,8,8: the 8s at positions 5, then 8 again at 8,9. Wait, need to check consecutive. Let me list the sequence:\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0:6, 1:8, 2:3, 3:3, 4:3, 5:8, 6:1,7:8,8:3,9:8,10:8,11:1, etc.\n\nSo the 3s are at 2,3,4: three in a row. Then 8 at 5 is single. Then 8 at 7 is single (since 7 is followed by 3 at 8). Then 8,8 at 9,10: two in a row. So no runs of 5. Next, at the end, 1,1,1 at positions 17,18,19 (three), then 3 at 20, so no. The rest are short runs. So no replacements here. So the output is the same as input for this line.\n\nAnother line in the test input: the fourth line is:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check:\n\nAfter 8,6, there's a run of 8s from index 6 to 15 (positions 6-15 inclusive). That's 10 8s. So replaced by 10 4s. Then later, starting at index 19 (1-based?), after 8,1 comes 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (positions 19-25, which is seven 1s). So replaced by seven 4s. So the output line would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nWait, let's count the positions correctly. Let me list the input line:\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1,17:3,18:8,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:8,27:3,28:6,29:8.\n\nSo from index 6 to 15 (inclusive) is 10 8s. So replace those with 4s. Then from index 19 to 25 (7 elements) all 1s. Replace those with 4s. So the output would have 4s from 6-15 (10 positions), then 4s from 19-25 (7 positions).\n\nAnother test line: the fifth line:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe run of 8s starts at index 6 (0-based) and goes to index 15 (10 8s). Then after that, from index 21 to 25 (five 1s). So replace those with 4s.\n\nSo for each line in the test input, I need to find all consecutive runs of 5 or more same numbers and replace each with 4, keeping the same length of the run.\n\nNow, applying this to each line of the test input. Let's go through each line.\n\nTest Input Line 0:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nCheck for runs of 5 or more. The runs are:\n\n- 3,3,3: length 3 \u2192 no.\n- 8,8 (at positions 9,10): length 2 \u2192 no.\n- 1,1,1 at positions 17-19: length 3 \u2192 no.\n- 2,2: length 2 \u2192 no.\n\nNo runs of 5, so output is same as input.\n\nTest Input Line 1:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 6,6 at positions 1-2: 2 \u2192 no.\n- 8,8 at 3-4: 2 \u2192 no.\n- 3,3 at 6-7: 2 \u2192 no.\n- 8,8 at 10-11: 2 \u2192 no.\n- 1,1 at 13-14: 2 \u2192 no.\n- 8,8 at 17-18: 2 \u2192 no.\n- 8,8,8 at 26-28: 3 \u2192 no.\n\nNo runs of 5. Output same.\n\nTest Input Line 2:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 8,8 at start: 2 \u2192 no.\n- From index 20 (0-based?), let's see:\n\nThe elements are:\n\nAfter index 20: 2, then 1,1,1,1,1,1 (positions 21-26) \u2192 six 1s. So replace with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this line will have 4s from 21 to 26 (indices 21-26).\n\nTest Input Line 3:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\nFrom index 20 to 26 (0-based), seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo positions 20-26 (inclusive) become 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 4:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nFrom index 6 (8) to 15: 8s. That's 10 consecutive 8s (indices 6-15). Replace with 10 4s.\n\nThen, from index 19 (1) to 25: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo line 4 output has two replaced segments.\n\nTest Input Line 5:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nIndices 6-15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nIndices 21-25: five 1s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 6:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nFirst, 3,3,3,3 \u2192 four 3s (indices 0-3) \u2192 no.\n\nThen, from index 6 (8) to 15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nThen, from index 22 (8) to 27: six 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, the input line is:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nSo indices 6-15: 8s (count 10).
