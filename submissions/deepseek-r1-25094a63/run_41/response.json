        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Then, apply that pattern to the test input to generate the correct output.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the training examples to identify the pattern. Let's take Example 0. Both the input and output are lists of numbers. Comparing them, I notice that some elements in the output are changed to 4s. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the consecutive 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9) are replaced with 4s. Similarly, the consecutive 2s starting at position 20 (indices 20-26) are also replaced with 4s. The same pattern applies to other input lists in Example 0 where there are consecutive numbers; they get replaced with 4s. But wait, in some cases, like the first two input lists in Example 0, there's no replacement. So maybe the pattern isn't just any consecutive numbers but specific conditions.\n\nLooking at Example 1's inputs and outputs, the same thing happens but with 4s again. For instance, in the third input list of Example 1:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the consecutive 6s starting at index 5 (positions 5-13) are replaced with 4s. Similarly, other sequences are replaced. So the pattern seems to be replacing a sequence of the same number (maybe longer than a certain length) with 4s. \n\nBut how long does the sequence need to be? Let's check the examples. In Example 0, the first input list has [8,8,8] at positions 6-8. The output still shows 8,8,8. So that's three 8s but they weren't replaced. However, in the third input list of Example 0, there's a sequence of six 8s (positions 4-9) which are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, in the same list, the seven 2s (positions 20-26) become seven 4s. So maybe the rule is that sequences of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers are replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Take the fourth input list in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\nOutput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\n\nHere, the sequence of six 8s is replaced by six 4s, and seven 2s are replaced by seven 4s. So the threshold seems to be sequences of 6 or more. Let's verify another example. In Example 0's 13th input list:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nHere, the sequence of six 3s starting at position 22 (indices 22-27) becomes five 4s? Wait, the input has 6 consecutive 3s (positions 22-27), but the output replaces positions 22-26 with 4s (5 elements) and leaves the 27th as 3. Wait, no. Let me count again. The input list's length is 30. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input (13th list in Example 0):\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nLooking at positions 22 to 27 (assuming 0-based index):\n\nIndices 22-27: elements 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, the output here replaces six 3s with five 4s and then a 3? That doesn't fit. Or maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the input has six 3s starting at index 22 (positions 22-27). The output has index 22 as 4, 23 as 4, 24 as 4, 25 as 4, 26 as 4, 27 as 3. So that's five 4s and then a 3. That's odd. So maybe the rule isn't exactly 6 or more. Maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequences to replace are exactly of length 6. Because in the first example, sequences of 6 were replaced. Let's check this. The input list in Example 0, third list, has six 8s (positions 4-9) and seven 2s (positions 20-26). The output replaces the six 8s with six 4s and the seven 2s with seven 4s. So maybe sequences of 6 or more. But the 13th list's output seems to have a problem. Wait, maybe I counted wrong. Let's check again.\n\nOriginal input for the 13th list in Example 0 (index 13):\n\nInput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nLooking at the elements starting from index 22 (0-based):\n\nIndex 22: 3\n\nIndex 23:3\n\nIndex24:3\n\nIndex25:3\n\nIndex26:3\n\nIndex27:3\n\nWait, that's 6 elements (indices 22 to 27) all 3s. So six 3s. The output for this part is 4,4,4,4,4,3. So five 4s and the last one remains 3. That's confusing. So maybe the pattern isn't exactly 6. Or perhaps there's a different condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied only once per list. Or perhaps the replacement is applied to the first occurrence of a run of 6 or more. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's 17th input list:\n\nInput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]\nOutput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the input has seven 1s starting at index 10 (positions 10-16). The output replaces them with seven 4s. So that's a sequence longer than 6. So why in the earlier example, a sequence of six 3s was only partially replaced? Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's recheck the 13th input list. The input is:\n\nOriginal input (13th list in Example 0):\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nLooking at the elements from index 22 to 27 (0-based):\n\nIndex 22:3, 23:3, 24:3, 25:3, 26:3, 27:3. That's six 3s. The output is:\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nSo indices 22-26 (5 elements) replaced with 4s, and index 27 is 3. So only five 4s. Hmm. That contradicts the previous pattern. So perhaps the pattern isn't consistent. Or maybe there's a different rule. Let me check the output again. Wait, maybe the original input was miswritten. Let me check the Example 0's output again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output for the 13th list:\n\nOutput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1] \u2192 No, wait, the output is:\n\nWait, the user's training example for Example 0's output lists the 13th output as:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nWait, no, perhaps I mixed up the lists. Let me recheck. The training examples are a bit long. Let me check the 13th input and output in Example 0.\n\nLooking back at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOUTPUT:\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nWait, the input has at index 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output replaces indices 22-26 (five elements) with 4s, and the last element (index 27) becomes 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe the original output has a typo? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that sequences of 6 or more are replaced, but the replacement starts after a certain point. Let's see. For example, in the third input list of Example 0, the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. So the entire run is replaced. Similarly, the seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. But in the 13th input list, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s and a 1. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps there's an error in the way I'm counting.\n\nWait, the output for the 13th list in Example 0 is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nThe input's elements from index 22 to 27 are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output from index 22 to 27 is 4,4,4,4,4,1. So five 4s followed by 1. That doesn't fit the pattern. Maybe the replacement is only for runs of exactly six? But that doesn't explain why the seven 2s were replaced. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the first run of six or more, and the rest are left. Or maybe there's another rule. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nTake the third input list in Example 1:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the input has nine 6s (indices 5-13). The output replaces all nine with 4s. So that's a run of 9 replaced with 9 4s.\n\nAnother example in Example 1:\n\nInput: [3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 8, 6, 3, 2, 6, 1, 6, 6, 2, 8, 8, 3, 2, 6, 6]\n\nOutput: [3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8, 6, 3, 2, 6, 1, 6, 6, 2, 8, 8, 3, 2, 6, 6]\n\nWait, the input here has a run of 9 6s (indices 5-13). Output replaces them with 9 4s. So that's consistent with the previous example.\n\nSo why in Example 0's 13th list, a run of 6 was replaced with five 4s and a 1? That's a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps I'm missing a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement isn't for consecutive numbers but for a different condition. Maybe it's replacing sequences of 8s and 6s. But in Example 0's third input, the 8s are replaced, but in the 13th list, 3s are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the longest consecutive sequence in the list, but that doesn't hold in all examples. For example, in Example 0's third input, there's a sequence of seven 2s (longer than the six 8s), and both are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is applied to any consecutive sequence of 6 or more elements, regardless of the number. So whenever there's a run of six or more identical numbers, replace each element in that run with 4. Let's see if that holds.\n\nIn Example 0's third input list, the six 8s and seven 2s are replaced. So that fits. In Example 0's 13th input list, there's a run of six 3s, which should be replaced with six 4s, but the output only has five 4s followed by a 1. That's conflicting. Wait, but looking again at the output for that list:\n\nOutput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nThe input's run of six 3s starts at index 22. The output has 4s at indices 22,23,24,25,26 (five positions), and index 27 is 1. That's odd. Unless there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps the actual rule is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is only applied to the first such run in the list. Let's check. In the third input list of Example 0, there are two runs (six 8s and seven 2s). Both are replaced. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers being replaced are specific, like 8s and 2s. But in the 13th list's case, the run is 3s being replaced. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is to replace runs of six or more with 4s, but only if they are part of certain positions. Like, starting from position X. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but the count includes the entire list. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the run of six 3s in the 13th list is interrupted by another number. Let's check the input again:\n\nInput (13th list Example 0):\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nLooking at elements after index 22: positions 22 is 3, then 23,24,25,26,27 are all 3s. So that's six consecutive 3s. But the output replaces indices 22-26 (five 3s) with 4s, and index 27 becomes 1. That's strange. Unless there's a typo in the example. But assuming the examples are correct, this suggests that my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that consecutive numbers are replaced with 4s only if they are part of a longer run than 5, but there's another condition. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is done only for runs of even length. But the six 8s in Example 0's third list are even, and the seven 2s are odd. Both are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility: the replacement occurs for runs of exactly six or more, but when the run is in the middle of the list and followed by another number, but in the case of the 13th list, maybe there's a mistake. Or perhaps the user made a typo in the example. But assuming the examples are correct, perhaps there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied only to runs that are followed by a certain number. For example, if after the run there's a specific element. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but starting at a certain position. For example, from position 4 onwards. But this also seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of six or more that are surrounded by certain numbers. But this would complicate the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace every 6th element in a run of six or more with a 4. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's look for another approach. Let's take all the input lists and their outputs and see where the 4s appear. The 4s in the output are only present where there were runs of six or more of the same number in the input. But in the case of the 13th list in Example 0, there's a run of six 3s replaced by five 4s and a 1. That doesn't fit. Unless perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Let's check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the training example for Example 0:\n\nThe 13th input list is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nThe corresponding output is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. The input has 3s from index 22 to 27 (inclusive). That's six elements. The output replaces index 22-26 (five elements) with 4s and leaves index 27 as 3. So that's six 3s in input becoming five 4s and one 3. That's inconsistent. Unless the run is not six but five. Wait, perhaps I'm counting incorrectly. Let me recheck:\n\nIndices start at 0.\n\nOriginal input list:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:8, 2:2, 3:8, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8,7:6,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:1,12:3,13:2,14:8,15:3,16:6,17:6,18:2,19:6,20:3,21:8,22:3,23:3,24:3,25:3,26:3,27:3,28:8,29:1.\n\nSo from index 22 to 27: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six elements). Output indices 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:3. So only five replaced. Hmm. This is perplexing.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different rule. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the 4s are replacing sequences of numbers that are not 4, and the sequences are exactly of length six. But the example with seven 2s being replaced with seven 4s contradicts that. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace every sixth occurrence of a number with 4. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that when a number appears six or more times consecutively, those positions are replaced with 4s. But then in the 13th example, the six 3s should be replaced with six 4s, but they're not. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the example, but assuming the examples are correct, perhaps the rule is different. Let's check another example where a run of six is replaced.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fourth input list:\n\nInput: [1,3,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,8,3]\n\nOutput: [1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,3]\n\nHere, the six 8s and seven 2s are replaced with 4s. So that's correct.\n\nIn Example 0's 13th list, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s and a 3. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that the run must be exactly six. Let's see. If a run is exactly six, replace with 4s. If longer, replace only the first six. But in the example with seven 2s, they are all replaced. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts from the first element of the run and continues until the end of the run, but in the 13th list's case, the run is six, but only five are replaced. This inconsistency is confusing.\n\nLet's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the position of the run matters. For example, the run must start at a certain index. Or perhaps the runs are replaced only in certain rows. But that's not likely, as the examples show multiple rows being affected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing the numbers that are part of a palindrome or some other structure. But that seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied only to certain numbers. For example, 8s and 2s. But in the 13th list, 3s are replaced, so that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to sequences of numbers that are not 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to the first occurrence of a run of six or more. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's third list, there are two runs: six 8s and seven 2s. Both are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nIn Example 0's 13th list, there's a run of six 3s followed by another number. But only five are replaced. So maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of exactly six or more and the same number as the first element of the list. But the first element of the 13th list is 8, and the replaced run is 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting tricky. Let's try to look for another approach. Perhaps the output is the same as the input, except that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by the same number of 4s. So regardless of what the number is, as long as it's a run of six or more, replace all with 4s. But then why in the 13th example, the run of six 3s is replaced by five 4s and a 3?\n\nThis suggests that either there's an error in the example, or the pattern is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but only if the run is followed by a different number. For example, in the third list of Example 0, the six 8s are followed by a 3, so replaced. The seven 2s are followed by a 6, so replaced. In the 13th list's case, the six 3s are followed by an 8. So they should be replaced. But in the output, only five are replaced. \n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the example. But assuming the examples are correct, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but the replacement starts after the fifth element. For example, the first five elements remain the same, and the sixth and onward are replaced. But that would explain the 13th list's case: six 3s. The first five remain 3, the sixth becomes 4. But in the example, the output is five 4s and one 3, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the entire run, but the run must be strictly longer than six. So seven or more. But the third example in Example 0 has a run of six, which is replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of even numbers. But the 3s in the 13th list are odd, and they're being replaced. So that's not.\n\nAnother approach: look for other differences between input and output. In all examples where 4s appear, they replace a sequence of the same number. But what about other numbers? Are there any other changes? For instance, in the first two input lists of Example 0, the output is the same as the input. So there are no changes. Only from the third list onward, there are changes where sequences are replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each list in the input, find all consecutive sequences of the same number that are six or more in length and replace each element in those sequences with 4.\n\nBut the 13th list's example contradicts this. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. Or perhaps there's a different rule. Let's assume that the examples are correct and there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input, let's take the third list:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, there's a run of six 1s from index 22 to 27. According to the pattern, these should be replaced with six 4s. \n\nAnother test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, from index 20 to 26: seven 1s. So replaced with seven 4s.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nThis has a long run of 8s starting at index 4. Let's count: index 4 (8) to index 15: 12 consecutive 8s. So replaced with 12 4s.\n\nBut according to the training examples, runs of six or more are replaced with 4s. So the answer for the test input would be to replace all such runs with 4s.\n\nBut given the inconsistency in the training example (the 13th list), maybe there's a mistake, but I'll proceed with the hypothesis that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\nFor each list in the test input, check for consecutive runs of six or more, and replace each element in those runs with 4.\n\nLet's take the third test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nThe run of six 1s (indices 22-27) should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nAnother test list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, the seven 1s from indices 20-26 become seven 4s.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth test input list:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe consecutive 8s from index 4 to 15: 12 8s \u2192 replaced with 12 4s.\n\nThe sixth test input list:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the consecutive 8s starting at index 5 (8) and extending to index 15: 11 8s \u2192 replaced with 11 4s.\n\nApplying this pattern across all test input lists.\n\nSo, the final step is to go through each list in the test input, find all runs of six or more identical numbers, replace each element in those runs with 4, and leave the rest as is."
