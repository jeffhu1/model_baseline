        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, looking at the input and output, the first two input rows are the same as the output. But starting from the third row, there are changes. Let's compare the third input and output rows:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, I notice that sequences of consecutive 8s in the input are replaced with 4s. Wait, but looking at the third input row, from index 4 to 9 (positions 5th to 10th elements), there are six 8s. In the output, these become six 4s. Then, later in the same row, from index 20 to 26 (elements 21st to 27th), there are seven 2s. In the output, these become seven 4s. So maybe any sequence of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s?\n\nWait, but let's check another row. Let's look at the fourth input row:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the six 8s (indices 4-9) become six 4s. Then the seven 2s (indices 20-26) become seven 4s. But the last two elements of that sequence are 2 and 2, which are replaced with 4s up to index 26, but the 27th element (index 26) becomes a 4, and the next element (index 27) is 2 in input and becomes 2 in output. Wait, in the input, from index 20 to 27, there are eight 2s. The output has seven 4s followed by a 2. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, let's count:\n\nOriginal input indices 20-27 (elements 21-28 in 0-based? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the positions. Let's say the input array is 0-based. So the input is:\n\n[1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nIndices 4-9: elements 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). Output replaces them with six 4s.\n\nIndices 20-27: elements 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). The output for these indices is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, the first seven are 4s and the eighth becomes 2. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace any run of exactly six or more consecutive same numbers with 4s for the entire run. But in this case, the run is eight 2s. But in the output, only seven are replaced with 4s and the eighth remains a 2. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of six or more consecutive same numbers with 4s, but only the first six elements of the run. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the input row, the 8s run is six elements (indices 4-9), replaced by six 4s. The 2s run is eight elements (indices 20-27). The output for this part is seven 4s followed by a 2. Wait, but seven 4s would cover indices 20-26 (seven elements), and index 27 is 2. So that's replacing a run of 8 with 7 4s and leaving one 2? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any run of six or more consecutive same numbers is replaced with 4s, but only for runs that are exactly six in length. But in the third example's input row, the first run is six 8s (replaced with 4s), and the second run is seven 2s, which is replaced with seven 4s. So perhaps the rule is that any consecutive run of the same number that is six or longer is replaced with 4s for the entire run.\n\nWait, in the third example's input, the second run of 2s is seven elements long. The output replaces all seven with 4s. In the fourth example, the run of 2s is eight elements long (indices 20-27). The output replaces the first seven with 4s and leaves the eighth as 2. Wait, but that's not the case. Let me check the fourth input and output again.\n\nInput fourth row: ... elements starting at index 20: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] (eight 2s). Output: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. Wait, how many 4s? The output for this part is \"4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2\", so seven 4s and the last 2. But why? That's confusing. Maybe there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for sequences of exactly six, and if the sequence is longer than six, only the first six are replaced, and the rest remain. But in the third input row, the second run is seven 2s, which are all replaced with 4s. That contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is for any consecutive run of six or more of the same number, but the entire run is replaced with 4s. But in the fourth example's run of eight 2s, why is the last one a 2?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recheck:\n\nFourth input row's output for the 2s run:\n\nInput indices 20-27: eight 2s.\n\nOutput: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. So seven 4s and one 2. That's eight elements. Wait, that's eight elements. So seven 4s and a 2. So why is the eighth element a 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the run is split into two parts. For example, maybe after replacing a run of six, the remaining two are left as is. But that doesn't fit because the entire run is eight elements. So replacing six with 4s and leaving the last two. But in the third example's output, a run of seven 2s was replaced with seven 4s. So that's different.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look at more examples. Let's check another row. Take Example 0's fifth input row:\n\nInput: [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\nOutput: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nHere, the input has a run of six 8s (indices 4-9) replaced by six 4s. Then a run of eight 2s (indices 20-27) is replaced by seven 4s followed by a 3. Wait, no, the output shows that the eight 2s are replaced with seven 4s and the last element remains 3? Wait, no, the input in this row's indices 20-27 are all 2s. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the input is [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nWait, the 2s run starts at index 19 (value 2) and continues to index 26 (elements 20-27?), making 8 elements of 2s. The output is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3]. Wait, no. The output for that part is:\n\nOriginal input indices 19-26 (elements 20-27 in 1-based? Maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me count correctly.\n\nWait, in 0-based indices:\n\nInput row 5 (from Example 0) is:\n\nIndices 0:3, 1:3, 2:8, 3:2, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8 (positions 0-9). So the first run of 8s is from index 4 to 9 (six elements), replaced by six 4s in output.\n\nThen, later in the input, starting at index 19 (element 20th in 1-based?), value is 2, followed by indices 20-26 (elements 21-27 in 1-based), making 8 elements of 2s. The output replaces these with seven 4s and then the original value (3) at index 27. Wait, but in the output, the last element of that run is 3. Wait, the original input's next element after the 2s is 3 at index 27. Wait, no. Let me check the input again.\n\nWait, the input row is:\n\n[3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nSo the sequence after index 19 (element 20) is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (indices 19-26?), which is eight 2s. Then the next element is 3 at index 27. So the output for indices 19-26 is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] (eight 4s?), but looking at the output:\n\nOutput row 5: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nWait, the output after index 19 (element 20) is 2 becomes 4, then 2s at indices 20-26 are replaced by 4s. Wait, the input indices 19-26 are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). The output for those indices is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3. Wait, no. The output for that part is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3], but how?\n\nWait, the original input for that part is eight 2s. The output is seven 4s followed by a 3. But why the 3? Because the next element in the input is 3 (at index 27). Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the run is of seven 2s and then a 3. But no, the input has eight 2s. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 1, the third input row:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the input has a run of nine 6s starting at index 5. The output replaces all nine with 4s. So the entire run of six or more is replaced with 4s, regardless of length. So that suggests that any run of six or more same numbers is replaced with 4s for the entire run. But earlier examples had a run of eight 2s being replaced with seven 4s and then a 2. But that contradicts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous examples. Let me recheck the fourth input row of Example 0.\n\nInput row 3 (from Example 0):\n\nInput: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nOutput: [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nAh, here the input has eight 2s starting at index 20 (elements 21 in 1-based). The output for those positions is seven 4s followed by a 2. Wait, the input indices 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight elements). The output indices 20-27: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So the first seven are 4s, and the last one is 2. But why?\n\nThis is inconsistent with the previous example where nine 6s became nine 4s. What's the difference here?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that runs of exactly six or more are replaced with 4s, but only the first six. But then in the case of nine 6s, they are all replaced. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different condition.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's third input row:\n\nInput: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\n\nOutput: [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\n\nHere, the first run of six 8s is replaced by six 4s, and the second run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. So in this case, the entire run is replaced. But in the fourth example's run of eight 2s, the output has seven 4s and one 2. That's a contradiction unless I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fourth input row's output:\n\nThe output for the fourth row is:\n\n[1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nLooking at the part after index 20: elements 20-27 (indices 20 to 27) are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 in input. The output for these indices is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So eight elements in input, but the output has seven 4s and one 2. How is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that if a run is exactly six, replace with six 4s. If it's longer than six, replace the first six with 4s and leave the rest as is. But in the third example's input, a run of seven 2s was replaced with seven 4s. That contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any run of six or more is replaced entirely with 4s. But why in the fourth example, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and one 2? Unless there's a mistake in the example or my observation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the positions. Let's check the exact indices again.\n\nFourth input row (Example 0):\n\nInput indices:\n\n0:1, 1:2, 2:8, 3:1, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8 (six 8s replaced by six 4s)\n\nThen later, indices 20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2 (eight 2s). Output for these indices is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. That's eight elements. So why is the last one a 2?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's check another example to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third input row:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the run of nine 6s (indices 5-13) is replaced by nine 4s. So that's a longer run being fully replaced. So why in the fourth example of Example 0, the eight 2s were not all replaced?\n\nThis inconsistency makes me think there's a different pattern. Maybe it's not about the length of the run but the position where it occurs. Or perhaps there's another factor.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for other changes. Are there any other transformations besides replacing numbers with 4s? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0, the first two input rows are unchanged. Starting from the third row, some runs are replaced with 4s. The same in Example 1: the first two input rows are unchanged, then starting from the third, some runs are replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that in each input list (each row), after the first occurrence of a run of six or more identical numbers, all subsequent runs of six or more are replaced with 4s. But that doesn't fit because in some rows there are multiple replaced runs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first run of six or more in a row is replaced, and others are left? No, in Example 0's third row, there are two runs replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps every run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s, but only if the number is 8. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the first run is eight 8s (replaced with six 4s?), but no, the input run was six 8s (indices 4-9) and replaced with six 4s. The second run is seven 2s replaced with seven 4s.\n\nSo it's not specific to the number 8. So the number itself doesn't matter, only the run length.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace any run of six or more identical numbers with 4s, and leave shorter runs as is. Let's test this:\n\nExample 0's third row: two runs of six and seven, replaced with 4s. Fourth row: runs of six and eight, replaced with 4s (but the eight run is replaced with seven 4s and one 2). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the first run is six 8s (replaced with six 4s), and the second run is seven 2s (replaced with seven 4s). So if the rule is to replace runs of six or more, then the entire run is replaced. But in the fourth row's eight 2s, the replacement is seven 4s and one 2. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my observation. Let me check the fourth input and output again.\n\nFourth input row (Example 0):\n\nInput: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nOutput: [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo the input's run of eight 2s starts at index 20 (element 21 in 1-based). The output replaces the first seven with 4s and the eighth remains a 2. So the input has eight 2s, and the output has seven 4s followed by a 2. Why?\n\nThis is inconsistent with other examples. Maybe there's a different rule. Let's think of another possibility. Perhaps the replacement is done only once per row, the first occurrence of a run of six or more, and others are left? No, because in the third row of Example 0, there are two runs replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts from the fifth element onward. Let's see. Looking at the third row of Example 0:\n\nInput starts with elements 1,8,3,1, then six 8s. Output replaces those six with 4s. Then later in the same row, the seven 2s are replaced. So the replacement can happen anywhere in the list, not just after a certain index.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is for any run of six or more, but the replacement is to replace all instances of the number in the run with 4s. For example, if the run is of 8s, replace each 8 with 4. But in the third row, the run of 8s is six, replaced with six 4s, and the run of 2s is seven, replaced with seven 4s. So it's replacing the number in the run with 4. So the rule could be: in a list, any consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for each element in that sequence.\n\nBut then why in the fourth row's eight 2s, only seven are replaced. Unless there's a mistake in the example. Let me check the fourth row again.\n\nFourth input row:\n\nIndices 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). Output indices 20-27: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. Why the last 2 remains?\n\nMaybe there's a typo in the example, or perhaps I'm missing a pattern. Let's consider other possibilities. Maybe the replacement is to replace the first six elements of a run of six or more with 4s, and leave the rest as is. So for a run of eight, replace the first six with 4s, leave the last two as original.\n\nIn the third row's run of seven 2s, replacing the first six with 4s and leaving one. But in the third row's output, the entire seven 2s are replaced with 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace the entire run with 4s if the run is exactly six, but if longer than six, replace with 4s for the first six and leave the rest. But in the third example, the seven 2s are all replaced, which would contradict that.\n\nThis is perplexing. Let's look for other patterns. Maybe the replacement is not based on the run length but the position in the list. For instance, the fifth element onwards, but that doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number 4 is used to replace sequences that are part of a larger pattern, like every sixth element. But that doesn't align with the examples.\n\nAnother approach: compare all the input and output rows where replacements occurred. Let's list them:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Row 2: 6 8s \u2192 6 4s; 7 2s \u2192 7 4s.\n- Row 3: 6 8s \u2192 6 4s; 8 2s \u2192 7 4s and 1 2.\n- Row 4: 6 8s \u2192 6 4s; 8 2s \u2192 7 4s and 1 6.\nWait, no. Let's check row 4:\n\nRow 4 input: [1,3,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,8,3]\n\nOutput: [1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,3]\n\nSo the run of six 8s becomes six 4s, the run of seven 2s becomes seven 4s, and the 6 remains. So why in row 3, the eight 2s are replaced with seven 4s and one 2 remains. This inconsistency is puzzling.\n\nPerhaps there's a different pattern. Let's consider that the replacement is applied to runs of exactly six consecutive numbers. If a run is longer than six, it's not replaced. But in Example 1's third row, a run of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but only if they are preceded by a certain number. This seems unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the test input now. The test input has several rows. For example, the third test input row is:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking at this, there's a run of six 1s starting at index 20 (elements 21-26). Following the pattern from the training examples, this run would be replaced with six 4s. The output should have 4s there.\n\nAnother test row is the fifth input row:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nHere, there's a run of nine 8s starting at index 6. Following the training examples, this would be replaced with nine 4s.\n\nBut in the training examples, when there's a run longer than six, like nine 6s, they were replaced with nine 4s. So the pattern seems to be that any run of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire run.\n\nBut why in Example 0's fourth row, the eight 2s were replaced with seven 4s and a 2? Unless there's a mistake in the example, which is possible but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace all elements in the run except the last one. For example, a run of six would be replaced with five 4s and one original? But no, in the third row's six 8s, all are replaced with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count starts after the first element. For example, after six consecutive elements, the rest are replaced. But this is not matching.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the transformation is to replace every occurrence of six or more consecutive numbers with 4s, but the replacement starts from the sixth element of the run. For example, in a run of eight, the sixth, seventh, and eighth elements are replaced with 4s. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire run is replaced with 4s only if the run is exactly six. If the run is longer, only the sixth element is replaced. But this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps the pattern is to replace any run of six or more identical numbers with 4s for the entire run, and the previous discrepancies were due to my miscounting or a typo in the example. Let's proceed with that assumption and test it against the test input.\n\nFor the test input, take the third row:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nThe run of six 1s at indices 20-25 (elements 21-26) would become six 4s.\n\nThe sixth test input row:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nThe run of 8s starts at index 4 and goes to index 15 (elements 5-16?), which is twelve 8s. These would all be replaced with 4s.\n\nBased on this, the answer would involve replacing any consecutive run of six or more of the same number with 4s for the entire run. So for the test input, wherever there's a run of six or more same numbers, replace them all with 4s.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\nFor example, the third test input row:\n\nInput: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nThe run of six 1s (indices 20-25) becomes six 4s. The output for that part would be 4,4,4,4,4,4.\n\nThe fifth test input row:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nHere, there's a run of ten 8s starting at index 6. All would be replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother test row: the fourth test input row:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nThe run of seven 1s (indices 20-26) becomes seven 4s.\n\nSo applying this rule to the entire test input, each run of six or more same numbers becomes 4s.\n\nTherefore, the answer for each row in the test input would be the same as the input but with all runs of six or more same numbers replaced by 4s."
