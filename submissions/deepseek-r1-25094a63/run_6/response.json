        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0 and Example 1, I notice that in each input list, there are sequences of numbers that are replaced with the number 4 in the output. For instance, in Example 0's third input list:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the sequence of eight 8s starting at position 4 (index 4) in the input becomes six 4s in the output. Wait, no\u2014the input has six 8s there (indices 4-9), and the output replaces them with six 4s. Similarly, the seven 2s starting at index 20 in the input are replaced with seven 4s. Hmm, but the number of 4s seems to match the length of the consecutive sequence in the input. So maybe any run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length?\n\nWait, let's check another example. In Example 0's first input, the output is the same as the input. Looking at the first two input lists in Example 0:\n\nFirst input: [3,3,2,6,...], output is same. So maybe there are no runs of 6 or more in the first two lists, so they remain unchanged.\n\nLooking at the third input list in Example 0: after the first few elements, there's a run of eight 8s (indices 4-9), but in the output, it's replaced with six 4s. Wait, wait, the input shows eight 8s, but the output replaces them with six 4s. Wait, the input has 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s?), no. Let me count again. Let's look at the input:\n\nThird input line: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nThe 8s start at index 4 (0-based) and go for 6 elements (positions 4-9 inclusive, which is 6 elements). Then in the output, those 6 8s are replaced with 6 4s. Similarly, the 2s starting at index 20 (value 2) are seven 2s. But the output replaces them with seven 4s. So the pattern here is that consecutive runs of the same number with length >=6 are replaced by 4s of the same length. So any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's third input, the first run is 6 elements, replaced by 6 4s. Then the next run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. That fits. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's third input line:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the run of 9 6s (indices 5-13) is replaced by 9 4s. So the rule seems to be: replace any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nBut wait, in the first two input lists of Example 0, the output is the same as the input. Let's check those for any runs of 6 or more.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input list:\n\n[3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs. Let's see:\n\nAt positions 6-8: three 8s. Then positions 10-14: five 3s. Then positions 18-19: two 8s. Then positions 21-22: two 2s. So no runs of 6 or more, so output remains same. Similarly for the second input list.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each input list, find consecutive runs of the same number where the length is 6 or more, and replace each such run with 4s of the same length. All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nLet me check another example in the training data to confirm.\n\nTake Example 0's 13th input line (counting from 0):\n\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOutput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nLooking at the input, after index 21 (0-based), there's a run of five 3s (indices 22-26: 3,3,3,3,3). Wait, that's five 3s. But the output here is replaced with 4s of the same length? Wait, no. Wait, the input has 3,3,3,3,3 (five), but in the output, indices 22-26 are 4,4,4,4,4, then index 27 is 3. Wait, the output shows six 4s? Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the input line for example 0's 13th input is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nLooking at the elements starting at index 22 (0-based): 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. That's six 3s (positions 22-27). So in the output, these six 3s are replaced with six 4s. The output line is:\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1]\n\nWait, but the original input's positions 22-27 are six 3s. The output shows six 4s (indices 22-27). But in the given output for example 0, the 13th output line is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nThe original input for example 0's 13th input line (index 13) is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nSo starting at index 22 (element 3), the next elements are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (positions 22-27, which is six 3s). The output for this line is:\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1]\n\nBut the example shows the output as:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Wait, the output given in example 0 for the 13th line is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, that's only five 4s followed by a 3. But the input has six 3s. Hmm, this contradicts the previous pattern. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the count is different. Let me recount the input line again. Let's write out the elements:\n\nIndices 0-29 (30 elements):\n\n0:8,1:8,2:2,3:8,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:6,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:1,12:3,13:2,14:8,15:3,16:6,17:6,18:2,19:6,20:3,21:8,22:3,23:3,24:3,25:3,26:3,27:3,28:8,29:1.\n\nSo from index 22 to 27: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output for these positions is 4,4,4,4,4,3. Wait, but in the given output, it's [...,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]. So index 22 is 4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:3. But that's five 4s and one 3. But the input had six 3s. That doesn't fit the earlier pattern.\n\nSo this suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. Maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the runs that are replaced are of exactly 6 elements. Let's check.\n\nIn example 0's third input, the run is six 8s (indices 4-9), which is replaced with six 4s. Then the next run is seven 2s (indices 20-26), which is replaced by seven 4s. But in the 13th input line, the run of six 3s is replaced by five 4s and one 3. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement starts after the sixth element. Wait, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six. But that doesn't fit because in the third example, seven 2s are replaced by seven 4s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace the first six elements of any run of six or more with 4s, and leave the rest as they are. But in the third input example, the seven 2s become seven 4s. So that wouldn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done only if the run is exactly six, but not longer. But that doesn't fit the third example where seven 2s are replaced.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look for another example. Let's take Example 0's 18th input:\n\nInput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]\nOutput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nIn the input, starting at index 10, there are seven 1s. In the output, these seven 1s are replaced by seven 4s. So the pattern here is that any run of 6 or more is replaced entirely by 4s, regardless of the length. So the 13th input line's case must be a mistake, but according to the training example, the output shows five 4s followed by a 3. Wait, maybe there's a different rule. Let me check that 13th example again.\n\nWait, the input for the 13th example in example 0 is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nSo the run of six 3s at positions 22-27 is replaced with four 4s and then two 3s? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the output given is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nSo the run of six 3s becomes five 4s and then a 3. Wait, that's six elements. So five 4s and one 3. That's six elements. But the input had six 3s. Why isn't it all replaced with 4s? That breaks the previous pattern. Hmm, this suggests that my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different condition. Let's look for another example. Let's look at Example 0's 12th input and output:\n\nInput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nOutput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nAh, here the input has a run of six 3s starting at index 22 (positions 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3). The output replaces these six 3s with four 4s and then two 3s? Wait, no. Wait, the output for these positions is 4,4,4,4,4,1. Wait, index 22:3 becomes 4, 23:3 becomes 4, 24:3 becomes 4, 25:3 becomes 4, 26:3 becomes 4, 27:3 becomes 1. But in the input, those six 3s are replaced by five 4s and a 1. That's not matching the pattern. So this is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different pattern here. Maybe the replacement is only for runs of exactly six, and longer runs are left as is, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for the first six elements of any run of six or more. Let's check:\n\nIn example 0's 13th input, the run of six 3s is replaced with five 4s and then a 3. That doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the index is different. Let me recheck the input and output again for example 0's 13th line.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the indices. Let's list the elements again for the input of example 0's 13th line:\n\nInput indices 0-29:\n\n0:8,1:8,2:2,3:8,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:6,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:1,12:3,13:2,14:8,15:3,16:6,17:6,18:2,19:6,20:3,21:8,22:3,23:3,24:3,25:3,26:3,27:3,28:8,29:1.\n\nSo the run of 3s starts at index 22 (element 3) and ends at index 27 (element 3). Six elements. The output for these positions is:\n\n22:4,23:4,24:4,25:4,26:4,27:3.\n\nSo five 4s and one 3. That's a total of six elements. This contradicts the previous pattern. So perhaps the pattern isn't to replace all elements in a run of six or more with 4s. So what's different here?\n\nLooking at other examples, let's take Example 0's 20th input line:\n\nInput: [2,6,8,3,6,1,3,8,3,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,3,1,6,3,3,6,1,3,2,2]\n\nOutput: [2,6,8,3,6,1,3,8,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,3,3,1,6,3,3,6,1,3,2,2]\n\nHere, the run of seven 1s (indices 10-16) becomes seven 4s. So the previous pattern holds here. But why in the 13th example, a six-element run is only partially replaced?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another condition, like the position of the run. For example, if the run occurs after a certain position in the list. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement happens only if the run is preceded and followed by different numbers. Let's check the 13th input line:\n\nThe run of six 3s starts at index 22. Let's see what's before and after. Before is index 21: 8. After is index 28:8. So the run is between 8 and 8. Wait, so the 3s are between two 8s. Hmm, but why would that matter?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied only to runs of even length, but six is even. In the 13th example, the run is six, which is even, but replaced with five 4s and one 3, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the sixth consecutive element. For example, every sixth and subsequent element in a run is replaced with 4. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the first occurrence of a run of six or more in the list with 4s. Let's check the 13th example again. The input has a run of six 3s, but in the output, it's replaced with five 4s and one 3. So perhaps the first five are replaced, and the sixth remains. But why?\n\nThis is perplexing. Let's look for another example in the training data where a run of exactly six elements is replaced.\n\nExample 0's third input line has a run of six 8s replaced by six 4s. The output line for that is:\n\n[1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\n\nSo six 8s become six 4s. Then a run of seven 2s becomes seven 4s. So the pattern seems to hold. But why the discrepancy in the 13th example?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement's example. But assuming the examples are correct, I must find a pattern that fits all.\n\nLooking at the 13th input line's output again:\n\nInput run: six 3s (indices 22-27).\n\nOutput for those positions: 4,4,4,4,4,3.\n\nSo the first five are replaced with 4s, the sixth remains as 3. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but the replacement starts from the second element. For example, replace elements starting from the second to the sixth. But that doesn't fit other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to leave the first element as is and replace the next five. But that would turn a six-element run into 1 original followed by five 4s, totaling six elements. For example, [3,3,3,3,3,3] becomes [3,4,4,4,4,4]. But in the 13th example's output, it's [4,4,4,4,4,3]. So the first five are replaced, the sixth remains. That would require a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but only up to the first five elements. But that doesn't fit other examples.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's think differently. Maybe the 4s are replacing the middle of the runs, leaving the first and last elements. For example, a run of six would have the middle four elements replaced. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are replacing all elements except the first and last. For a run of six, that would replace four elements. But in example 0's third input, a run of six 8s is replaced by six 4s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement depends on the value of the run. For example, replacing runs of 8s or 6s. But looking at the examples, it's not the case. The first example's third input has 8s replaced, the 13th has 3s, others have 1s, etc.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each line and see exactly which runs are replaced.\n\nTake example 0's 13th input line:\n\nInput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nOutput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nThe run of six 3s in the input becomes five 4s and a 3. So the first five 3s are replaced with 4s, and the sixth remains a 3. Why?\n\nBut why in other runs of six or more, like the third example's run of six 8s, all are replaced. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is applied only if the run is followed by a different number. Let's check. In the third example, the six 8s are followed by 1. So they are replaced. In the 13th example, the six 3s are followed by 8. So perhaps the replacement is applied only to runs that are followed by a different number. But in the 13th example, the run of six 3s is followed by 8 (element 28:8). So the run is replaced, but why only five 4s and one 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement stops when the next element is the same. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of exactly six, but for runs longer than six, only the first six are replaced. But in example 0's third input line, there's a run of seven 2s replaced with seven 4s. So that contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the first six elements of any run of six or more with 4s, and leave the rest as-is. Let's test this:\n\nIn the third example's seven 2s, replacing the first six with 4s and leaving the seventh as 2. But in the output, all seven are replaced with 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the pattern is that in each list, the longest consecutive run is replaced with 4s. But that doesn't fit the examples, as sometimes multiple runs are replaced.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the first run of six or more is replaced. Let's see:\n\nIn example 0's third input line, there are two runs of six or more. Both are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps every run of six or more is replaced, but in the 13th example, perhaps the run is not exactly six. Wait, no. The run is exactly six elements. So why is it not all replaced?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in how I'm counting the elements. Let me recount for the 13th example's run:\n\nInput: 3,3,3,3,3,3. Six elements. Output: 4,4,4,4,4,3. So five 4s and one 3. Total six elements. That doesn't fit any pattern. Unless there's a different rule here.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is to replace every other element in the run with 4. For a run of six, that would be three 4s. But no, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first five elements of a run of six are replaced. So for a run of six, five 4s and one original. That's what happened in the 13th example. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut then in example 0's third input line, the six 8s are replaced by six 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis inconsistency is making it hard to find the pattern. Let's try to find another example.\n\nExample 0's 18th input:\n\nInput: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nOutput: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nHere, there's a run of seven 1s, replaced by seven 4s. So the pattern holds here.\n\nExample 0's 19th input:\n\nInput: [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nOutput: [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nHere, the run of ten 1s is replaced by seven 4s and then three 1s. Wait, no. The input has ten 1s from index 10 to 19. The output replaces indices 10-16 (seven elements) with 4s, and leaves indices 17-19 as 1s. But the run in the input is ten consecutive 1s. So why is only the first seven replaced?\n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern of replacing all elements in the run. So perhaps the pattern is to replace the first occurrence of a run of exactly six or more with 4s, and not subsequent elements. But in this case, the run is ten elements, and the output replaces the first seven with 4s. That's not aligning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the first six elements of any run of six or more. So for a run of ten 1s, the first six are replaced with 4s, leaving four 1s. But in this example, the output has seven 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's a different pattern entirely. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the examples, in some cases, the output lists have 4s replacing sequences, and sometimes not. Let's look for any other patterns. For example, maybe the sum of the elements in the run is a multiple of a certain number, or the sum is replaced with 4s. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing sequences where the same number appears six times in a row, but the replacement is to insert 4s for the entire run. But the examples with seven elements being replaced with 4s (like the 18th input) suggest that the entire run is replaced, regardless of length.\n\nBut then why in the 13th example, a six-element run is replaced with five 4s and one 3?\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in my observation of the training examples. Let me recheck example 0's 13th input and output again.\n\nExample 0's 13th input:\n\nInput line 13 (index 13):\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOutput line 13:\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, the output for position 27 is 3. So in the input, positions 22-27 are six 3s. In the output, positions 22-26 are 4s (five 4s), and position 27 is 3. So the run is five 4s and one 3.\n\nBut why? That's not aligning with other examples. Maybe the pattern is to replace runs of exactly six with five 4s and the last element remains? But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for all elements except the last one. So a run of six would have five 4s and the last element unchanged. But in example 0's third input, a run of six 8s is replaced with six 4s, which contradicts this.\n\nThis is really perplexing. Let's consider another angle. Maybe the 4s are replacing runs of even numbers. But in example 0's third input, the 8s are even, replaced with 4s. In the 13th example, 3s are odd, but they are replaced with 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the number. For example, if the run is of 8s, replace with 4s. But in example 0's third input, there's a run of 2s replaced with 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 4s are replacing any run of six or more of the same number, but only if that number is not 4. But in example 0's third input, the 8s are replaced with 4s, but in other cases, the 4s are already present in the input. For example, in example 0's input line 0, there are no 4s in the input or output. So the 4s are only introduced in the output.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: replace any consecutive run of six or more of the same number (excluding 4) with 4s of the same length.\n\nBut then why does the 13th example's output have a 3 in the middle of the replaced run?\n\nThis is frustrating. Let's try to find another example where a run of six is replaced differently.\n\nLooking at example 1's third input line:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, a run of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s. So the entire run is replaced. This aligns with the initial hypothesis.\n\nAnother example from example 1's input line 17:\n\nInput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nOutput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nHere, a run of seven 8s is replaced with seven 4s. So again, the entire run is replaced.\n\nBut in example 0's 13th line, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s and one 3. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in the example. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a detail. Let's look at the 13th input line's output again. The output has at position 27 a 3. But in the input, position 27 is 3. So the last element of the run is not replaced. Maybe the rule is to replace the first five elements of any run of six or more with 4s, and leave the rest. But that doesn't fit other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts at the first element of the run and replaces the next five elements, making a total of six elements. For example, a run of six would have five replaced and one original. But that's not the case in other examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's consider that perhaps there's a mistake in the examples, but assuming they are correct, I must find a pattern that fits all.\n\nWait, looking at the 13th example's input and output again:\n\nInput run: six 3s (positions 22-27).\n\nOutput: positions 22-26 are 4s (five), and position 27 is 3.\n\nBut wait, the output for position 27 is 3. But in the input, position 27 is also 3. So the last element of the run is not replaced. Maybe the rule is to replace the first five elements of a run of six or more, and leave the rest. But why?\n\nFor example, if the run is six elements long, replace five with 4s. If it's seven elements, replace six, etc. But that doesn't fit other examples.\n\nIn example 0's third input line, a run of six 8s is replaced with six 4s. So this would contradict that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace all elements except the last one in a run of six or more. So for a run of six, five 4s and the last element remains. For a run of seven, six 4s and the last remains. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 0's third input line, the run of six 8s would become five 4s and one 8. But the output shows six 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nIn example 0's 18th input line, the run of seven 1s becomes seven 4s. So again, no.\n\nThis is really puzzling. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think about the positions of the 4s in the outputs. For instance, in example 0's third input line, the 4s start at position 4 (0-based). In the output, those 4s are in the same positions. So the replacement is in the same location as the run.\n\nBut why in the 13th example, the replacement is not complete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but only up to a maximum of five replacements. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done in the middle of the list. For example, the first half of the run is replaced. But that's not systematic.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the inconsistency in the 13th example, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis: any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length. I'll apply this rule to the test input and see if the output matches.\n\nLooking at the test input, I need to process each list and replace any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more. Let's scan the list:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three 3s\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 1,1,1: three\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo runs of six or more, so output is the same as input.\n\nSecond test input list:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nScanning for runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three\n- 2: single\n\nNo runs of six or more.
