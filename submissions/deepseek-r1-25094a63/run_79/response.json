        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to modify some parts of the input. Let's compare the input and output for the first example, Example 0.\n\nIn the input of Example 0, take the third list: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The output for this is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]. Oh, I notice that sequences of 8s in the input are replaced with 4s. Wait, but in the input here, from index 4 to 9 (elements 8,8,8,8,8,8) are replaced by four 4s each? Wait, no, the output shows 6 elements (positions 4-9) as fours. Wait, 6 elements replaced by 4s. Hmm, but why 4?\n\nWait, maybe it's about runs of the same number. Let's check another example. Take the second example's input in Example 0. The third list's input has a run of six 8s starting at position 4. The output replaces them with six 4s. Then later in the same list, there's a run of seven 2s starting at position 20 (indices 20-26) which becomes seven 4s. Wait, the output shows seven 4s there. So the pattern might be that consecutive numbers longer than a certain length are replaced with 4s. But how long is that threshold?\n\nLooking at the first example's input lists. Let's check other lists. For example, in the first list of Example 0's input: [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]. The output for this list doesn't have any 4s. Hmm. So maybe only runs of a certain length get replaced. Let's check when 4s appear. In the third list of Example 0's output, the runs that were replaced were of 6 and 7 elements. Wait, in the input of Example 0, third list, the first run is six 8s. In the output, those six 8s become six 4s. Then later, the seven 2s become seven 4s. So perhaps any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s. Let me check another example.\n\nTake Example 1. Let's look at the third input list in Example 1: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. The output replaces the nine 6s starting at index 5 with 4s. So nine 6s become nine 4s. So that fits the pattern. So the rule seems to be: in each list, whenever there is a consecutive sequence (run) of the same number that is 6 or longer, replace all elements in that run with 4s. Other elements remain the same.\n\nWait, let's check the first list in Example 0. The input is [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]. The output is the same as the input. So the first list's input doesn't have any runs of 6 or more, so no replacement. The third input list had a run of six 8s, which were replaced. So the pattern is replacing runs of exactly 6 or more with 4s. Let's confirm with another example.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input list: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]. The output has six 4s where the six 8s were (indices 4-9), and seven 4s where the seven 2s (indices 20-26) were. So yes, any run of 6 or more same numbers becomes 4s. The same in the other examples.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each consecutive sequence of the same number in the input list, if the length of the sequence is 6 or more, replace each element in that sequence with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each of the test input lists and check for runs of 6 or more same numbers. For each such run, replace them with 4s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nThe first list is [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. Let's check for runs of 6. The longest runs here are three 3s, then later three 1s, etc. So no runs of 6. So the output is the same as input.\n\nThe second list: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. Again, no runs of 6. The longest might be two 8s here and there.\n\nThird list: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, looking at positions 20-25 (indices 20-25 in 0-based?), elements are 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So this run of six 1s would be replaced by six 4s. The output list would have 4s there.\n\nFourth list: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. In this list, starting at index 20 (assuming 0-based), there's a run of seven 1s (from index 20 to 26). So replace those seven 1s with 4s.\n\nFifth list: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. Here, the run of 8s starts at index 6 (elements 6-15?), let's count. The sequence is 8,6, followed by 8s starting at index 4 (original list: 8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,...). Wait, original list fifth line:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking at elements starting at position 6 (index 5 is 6?), no. Let me count from 0:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8, etc. So from index 6 to 15: that's 10 consecutive 8s. So replace all 10 8s with 4s. Then there's a run of seven 1s at the end (indices 20-26) which would be replaced by 4s.\n\nWait, the input line is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. So after the 6 (index5), we have a run of 10 8s (indices6-15). Then after that, there's 1,3,8, then a run of seven 1s (indices19-25?), let's check:\n\nIndices 16:1,17:3,18:8,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:8. So the run of seven 1s is from index19 to 25 (inclusive: 7 elements). So replace those with 4s.\n\nSo in the output list, the 10 8s become 10 4s, and the seven 1s become seven 4s.\n\nContinuing this for all test input lists, replacing any runs of 6 or more same numbers with 4s.\n\nNow, let's go through each list in the test input and apply this rule.\n\nFor example, the sixth test input list is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. Wait, the actual sixth list in test input is:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nWait, the input list is:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Wait, perhaps the user's test input lists may vary. Let me check the actual test input as given.\n\nLooking back at the test input:\n\nThe fifth list is:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nIn this list, there's a run of 8s from index6 to 15 (assuming 0-based). That's 10 elements (8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). So replace with 4s. Then at the end, there's a run of five 1s (indices 20-24?), which is 5 elements, so no replacement. Wait, the list elements from index20-24 are 1,1,1,1,1 (five 1s), which is length 5. So no replacement here. The sixth element is 1,1,1,1,1 (5 elements), but the next element is 6, so no. So in this list, the 10 8s become 4s.\n\nAnother example: the seventh test input list is:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nHere, there's a run of 8s starting at index6. Let's count: from index6 to index15, which is 10 elements (8,8,...8), then index16 is 8, so total 11 8s. So this run of 11 is replaced by 4s. Also, at the end there's a run of three 8s (indices25-27: 8,8,8), which is less than 6, so no replacement.\n\nSo for each test input list, we need to check each consecutive run. If the run's length is >=6, replace each element in the run with 4. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nNow, applying this to each list in the test input.\n\nOnce all runs are checked and replaced where necessary, the output will be the transformed lists.\n\nThe final answer should be each test input list, modified with the above rule."
