        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output lists. The first thing I notice is that in some of the examples, parts of the input are replaced with the number 4 in the output. For instance, in Example 0's third input list, the part that was [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] in the input becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4] in the output. Similarly, in Example 1's third input list, a sequence of six 6s becomes six 4s. \n\nHmm, so maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number, those are replaced with 4s. Let me check more examples.\n\nLooking at the first example in Example 0: the first input list doesn't have any sequences of six same numbers, so the output is the same. The second input list also doesn't have such a sequence. But the third input starts with [8,8,8,8,8,8], which becomes six 4s. So that fits. Another example in Example 0: the fourth input list has [8,8,8,8,8,8] again, replaced by six 4s. But in some cases, like the eighth input list of Example 0, there's a sequence of 2s repeated seven times in the input (positions 20-26 are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2) and in the output, these become seven 4s. Wait, but in the output given, it's replaced with 4,4,4,4,4,4,4. So the number of 4s matches the length of the original sequence. So the rule might be: replace any run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but looking at the examples again. Let me verify. For instance, in Example 0's third input list, the input has eight 8s starting at position 4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output shows six 4s. Wait, the input for that list is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, ...]. So from index 4 to 9 (if 0-based), that's six 8s. The output is [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,...]. So six 4s. So the rule is that a run of exactly six same numbers is replaced by six 4s. What about longer runs? Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's third input list (the first test input in Example 1), the input has a sequence of nine 6s. The output replaces them with nine 4s. Wait, the input was [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8, ...]. The output for that part is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So nine 6s become nine 4s. So the rule is that any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length. So regardless of how long the run is (as long as it's 6 or longer), replace all elements in the run with 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's input list 18 (the 18th input in Example 0), the input is [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, ...]. The output is [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,...]. Here, the input has seven 1s (positions 10-16), which are replaced by seven 4s. So again, the length matches. So the rule is: in each list, find consecutive runs of the same number where the length is at least 6, and replace each element in those runs with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nSo the transformation is: for any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each element in that sequence with 4. All other elements stay as they are.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at each of the test input lists and check where there are consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers.\n\nLet's take the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three in a row. Not 6.\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two. Not enough.\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo runs of 6 here. So the output is the same as input.\n\nNext list:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs of 6:\n\nLooking through:\n\n1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2\n\nNo runs here. The longest is 3,3, then 8,8, but nothing reaches 6. So output same.\n\nThird test list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nCheck for runs. The part starting at position 21 (assuming 0-based) is 1,1,1,1,1,1. That's six 1s. So this sequence should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nSo the input has [..., 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, ...]. The output should be [..., 2, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 8, ...].\n\nFourth test list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. At the end, there's 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo the part from position 20 to 26 (assuming 0-based) is seven 1s. Replace each with 4.\n\nFifth test list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence of 8s from position 6 to 15 (assuming 0-based): eight 8s. Replace with 4s. So that's 10 elements? Wait, let's count:\n\nInput list fifth: positions after 8,6 are:\n\nindexes 6 to 15 (0-based):\n\n8 (index 6), 8,8,8,8,8,8 (indexes 6-11: six 8s), then 8,8,8 (indexes 12-14?), wait the input is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,...]. So starting from index 6 (the 7th element if starting from 0?), the 8s are from index 6 to 15 (inclusive). That's 10 elements (indices 6-15: 10 elements). So the run is 10 8s. So replace all with 4s. So in the output, this entire sequence becomes ten 4s.\n\nSixth test list:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s from index 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 10 4s. Then, after that, there's 1,1 (only two), then later 1,1,1,1,1 (five in a row). Five is less than six, so no change. So the 10 8s become 4s.\n\nSeventh test list:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nCheck runs. The 8s from index 4 (8) and then index 5 is 3, then starting from index 5, no. Wait the list is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...]. Wait, starting from index 4: 8 (index4), then index5 is 3. So that's a single 8. Then from index6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (indices 6-15: 10 8s). So that's a run of 10 8s. Replace with 4s. The 3s at the beginning are four in a row (indices 0-3: four 3s), which is less than six. So only the 10 8s are replaced.\n\nEighth test list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s start at index6 (0-based) and go to index16: that's 11 8s (indices6-16). So replace all 11 with 4s.\n\nNinth test list:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s from index6 to index15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at index18-20: three 8s. No change.\n\nTenth test list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\n\nThe 8s from index6 to index15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nEleventh test list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\n\nThe 8s from index5 to index14: 10 8s, then index15 is 8 again. Wait, the input is [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,...]. So from index5 to index15: 11 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwelfth test list:\n\n[6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\n\nCheck runs. The 2s at the end: three 2s. No. The 3,3: two. No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nThirteenth test list:\n\n[1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 6]\n\nCheck runs. 8,8 (two), then 2,2,2,2 (four), then 3,3,3 (three). No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nFourteenth test list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\n\nNo runs of 6. Output same.\n\nFifteenth test list:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 6, 1, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. 3,3,3 (three), 8,8,8 (three). No. So output same.\n\nSixteenth test list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6]\n\nCheck runs. 3,3,3 (three), 8,8 (two), 3,3,3 (three). No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nSeventeenth test list:\n\n[3, 8, 1, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. 8,8,8 (three). No. So output same.\n\nEighteenth test list:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 6, 1]\n\nCheck runs. 8,8 (two), 3,3 (two), 6, etc. No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nNineteenth test list:\n\n[3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 8]\n\nNo runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTwentieth test list:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence of 3,3,3,3,6,3... No. Wait, the input is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. So check runs. The 8s at the start: three. Then 3,3,3,3 (four), then 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six) starting at index 17? Wait, the list after 6 is 3,3,3,3,3,3. So indices 16-21 (assuming 0-based):\n\nAfter 6, the elements are 3,3,3,3,3,3. So that's six 3s. Replace with 4s. So positions 16-21 (six 3s) become six 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCheck runs. The sequence of 3s: 3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3. Hmm, no. Wait, the input is [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. Let's break it down. After the 1 at index10, we have 3,3 (index12-13), then 1 (index14), then 3,3,3,3,3,3 (index15-20). So that's six 3s. So replace those six with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second test list:\n\n[8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. The 3s from index16-22: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test list:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. The 3s from index16-21: six 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fourth test list:\n\n[1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\n\nCheck runs. The 3s from index16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test list:\n\n[1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\n\nCheck runs. The 3s from index16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth test list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\n\nCheck runs. The 3s from index13-20: eight 3s. Replace with eight 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nCheck runs. The 3s from index14-18: five 3s. Not enough. So no change.\n\nTwenty-eighth test list:\n\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\n\nCheck runs. The 8,8,8,8 (four) at indices 8-11. No.\n\nTwenty-ninth test list:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\n\nCheck runs. The 3,3,3,3 (four) at indices 6-9. No.\n\nThirtieth test list:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\nCheck runs. The 3,3,3 at the end (three). No.\n\nSo the final answer is each test input list with any runs of 6 or more identical numbers replaced by 4s of the same length, and others unchanged."
