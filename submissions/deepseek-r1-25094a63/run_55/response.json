        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists provided in the training examples, and then apply that pattern to the test input. \n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the training examples to identify any common transformations. Let's take Example 0. The input and output have several lists. Comparing the input and output lists, it seems like certain sequences of numbers are replaced with the number 4. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the original input has a sequence of six 8s starting at position 4, which in the output becomes six 4s. Then later, there's a sequence of seven 2s starting at position 20, which becomes seven 4s. Similarly, in the next list of the same example, a sequence of six 8s becomes six 4s. \n\nLooking at another example, Example 1's first few lists. For instance, the third input list in Example 1:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, a sequence of nine 6s starting at position 5 is replaced with nine 4s. So the pattern seems to involve replacing runs of the same number (maybe of a certain length) with 4s. But how long do the runs need to be?\n\nLooking at the first example's third list again: the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. In the same list, seven 2s become seven 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of 4 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length. Wait, but in Example 1's third input list, the nine 6s become nine 4s. So maybe the threshold is runs of 4 or more. Let me check other parts.\n\nIn Example 0's first two input lists, there are runs. Let's see the first input list:\n\nInput: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]\n\nOutput is the same as the input. So the 8s here are three in a row. So they are not replaced. Similarly, the second input list in Example 0:\n\nOriginal: [8,2,1,6,3,1,8,3,1,8,3,8,8,1,3,2,8,3,8,8,3,1,3,1,8,3,2,6,2,6]\n\nOutput is same as input. The runs here are two 8s, which are not replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that any consecutive sequence of 4 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's third input list, the 8s are six in a row, replaced by six 4s. The 2s are seven in a row, replaced by 4s. So yes, it's runs of four or more. So the rule is: in each list, replace any consecutive sequence of four or more identical numbers with 4s, keeping the same length of the run.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third input list's run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. So the replacement is to replace the number in the run with 4, and the length remains the same. So the transformation is to replace each run of four or more of the same number with 4s, maintaining the run's length.\n\nNow, let's verify this with all training examples. For instance, in Example 0's fifth input list:\n\nInput: [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nOutput: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nHere, the six 8s become six 4s, and the seven 2s become seven 4s. So yes, the pattern holds. Similarly, in Example 1's third input list, the nine 6s become 4s. \n\nSo the rule is: in each list, for any consecutive sequence of four or more identical numbers, replace all elements in that sequence with 4s. Other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each list in the test input and check for runs of four or more same numbers, replacing them with 4s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 4 or more. Let's check each number:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three in a row (not enough)\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two (not enough)\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three (not enough)\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo runs of four or more. So this list remains the same.\n\nSecond list:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three\n- 2: single\n\nThe three 8s at the end are three, so no replacement. So this list also remains the same.\n\nThird list:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check:\n\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 3: single\n- 2: single\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1: six in a row. So this run of six 1s would be replaced by six 4s.\n\nSo the output list would have [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nFourth list:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 2,2,2 (three) is not enough. Then later, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1: seven 1s. So this run would be replaced with seven 4s. The other elements stay the same.\n\nOutput would be: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3]\n\nFifth list:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s start at position 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Ten 8s in a row. So replace all with 4s. Then later, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1: seven 1s. Replace with 4s. The 8 at position 26 is single.\n\nSo output becomes: [8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nWait, the 8 run starts at index 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's count again. The input is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. So starting from index 6 (if 0-based, it's the 7th element), the sequence is eight 8s? Wait, let me check:\n\nPositions:\n\n0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1, etc.\n\nFrom index 6 to 15: that's 10 elements (indices 6-15 inclusive). So ten 8s. So replaced by ten 4s. Then the 1s from index 19 (value 1) to 25: seven 1s. So replaced by seven 4s. So the output list for this one would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nContinuing this process for each of the test input lists. The key is to check each list for runs of four or more identical numbers and replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's do a quick check on another test input list. Let's take the seventh list in the test input:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s start at position 6 (0-based) and go up to position 15: that's 10 8s. Then another run at position 25-27: three 8s. So the 10 8s (indices 6-15) become 4s. The next part has eight 8s (wait, no, the input is [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. So from index 6 to 16: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 11 8s (indices 6-16). So replaced by 11 4s. Then at indices 25-27: three 8s, so no replacement. So the output for this list would be:\n\n[3,3,1,3,2,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nSo each run of four or more same numbers is replaced with 4s. \n\nApplying this rule to all the test input lists will generate the correct output."
