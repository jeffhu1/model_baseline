        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several lists. Looking at the first input list and its corresponding output, they are the same. The second input and output are also the same. Then starting from the third input list, there are changes. Let's compare the third input and output:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nWait, in the output, starting from index 4 (the fifth element) there's a sequence of six 8s in the input that became six 4s. Then later, from index 20 onwards in the input, there's a sequence of seven 2s that became seven 4s. So it looks like consecutive numbers are being replaced by 4s. But how many consecutive numbers? Let's check the length. The first replacement is 6 elements (8s), replaced by 6 4s. The second replacement is 7 elements (2s) replaced by 7 4s. So maybe whenever there's a run of 6 or more of the same number, they're replaced by 4s of the same length? Or maybe the exact number of consecutive elements is replaced with 4s?\n\nLooking at the fourth input in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the input has a run of six 8s starting at index 4 (positions 4-9), which become six 4s. Then a run of eight 2s starting at index 20 (positions 20-27) which become seven 4s (wait, the output shows 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2). Wait, the input has eight 2s, but the output has seven 4s and then a 2. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Wait, let's count. Input indices 20-27: 8 elements (positions 20 to 27 inclusive). The output at those positions is seven 4s and a 2. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the input list for the fourth example's input is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nLooking at the elements from index 20 (starting at 0): positions 20-27 are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). The output for those positions in the output list is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. So the first seven are replaced with 4s, and the eighth remains 2. That's odd. So the pattern isn't simply replacing runs of exactly six or more. Alternatively, maybe the runs of six or more are replaced with 4s, but only up to the first six elements? No, because in the third example input, the first run of six 8s becomes six 4s, and the second run of seven 2s becomes seven 4s. Wait, but in the fourth example's input, the 8s run for six elements and become six 4s, and the 2s run for eight elements but only seven are replaced. Wait, maybe there's another condition here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the runs of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers are replaced with 4s. But in the fourth example's input, the 2s are eight in a row. The output replaces the first seven with 4s and leaves the eighth as 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the fourth example's output:\n\nOriginal input for that line: positions 20-27 (8 elements of 2s). The output in those positions is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, that's eight elements. So seven 4s and a 2. So why the last one is not replaced? Maybe the rule is that runs of exactly six are replaced, but longer runs have the first six replaced? But in the third example's input, a run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) are replaced by seven 4s. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s for the entire length. But in the fourth example, the run of eight 2s would become eight 4s, but in the output, it's seven 4s and then a 2. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the example? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the fourth example's input line is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nSo the part starting at position 20 (0-based) is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). The output for that line's corresponding part is:\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and a 2. That's odd. So maybe the rule isn't just replacing runs of six or more. Alternatively, perhaps the runs that are replaced are those of exactly six or exactly seven? But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but only the first six elements are replaced. Let's check.\n\nIn the third example input: the run of eight 8s (positions 4-9 in the input) becomes six 4s. Wait, the input has eight 8s (from index 4 to 11?), no wait, index 4 to 9 is six elements. Let me count again.\n\nWait the third input example is:\n\nInput: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\n\nSo from index 4 (element 5) to index 9 (element 10) is 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six elements). The output replaces those with six 4s. Then, starting at index 20 (element 21) in the input, there are seven 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So that's a run of six and seven, both replaced with 4s. But in the fourth example's input, the run of eight 2s is replaced by seven 4s and a 2. That doesn't fit. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting here.\n\nWait, the fourth example's output for the 2s run is:\n\nLooking at the output list for the fourth example in Example 0:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nThe positions 20-27 (elements 20 to 27) in the output are 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. That's seven 4s followed by a 2. But the input has eight 2s. So the first seven are replaced with 4s, and the eighth remains 2. Why is that?\n\nHmm, maybe there's another rule. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input lists. For example, the third input line in Example 1:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nThe output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the input has a run of nine 6s starting at index 5. The output replaces all nine with 4s. So that's nine 4s. So in this case, all elements in the run are replaced.\n\nAnother example in Example 1: the fourth input line:\n\nInput: [8,6,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,1,1,2,1,2,6,8,2,6,2,1,8,3,3,8]\n\nOutput: [8,6,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,1,1,2,1,2,6,8,2,6,2,1,8,3,3,8]\n\nAgain, the nine 6s are replaced with nine 4s.\n\nAnother example in Example 1: the seventh input line's output has a run of 8 elements replaced with 4s. So the pattern here seems to be that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire length of the run. So in the third example of Example 0, the six 8s are replaced with six 4s, and the seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. But in the fourth example of Example 0, the eight 2s are replaced with seven 4s and a 2. That seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that example.\n\nWait, looking again at the fourth example of Example 0:\n\nInput line 4's input is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe run of 8s here is from index 4 to 9 (six elements), replaced by 4s. Then the run of 2s starts at index 20 (element 20) and runs for 8 elements (indexes 20-27). The output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and a 2. But the input has eight 2s. So why is the last 2 not replaced?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a different rule. Let's check the output again. Wait, the output for that part in the fourth example is:\n\n[..., 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo indexes 20-27 (8 elements) in the output: seven 4s and one 2. But the input here is eight 2s. So why is the last one not replaced? Unless perhaps the run is split into two parts. Wait, maybe there's a break in the run. Let me check the input again.\n\nIn the input, after the 8s, the elements are:\n\nAt index 20: 2, then 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. That's eight consecutive 2s. So why is the output not eight 4s?\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. Maybe the rule is that runs of exactly 6 or more are replaced, but in some other way. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six. Wait, in the third example, the run of six 8s is replaced with six 4s. In the fourth example, the run of eight 2s is split into seven and one, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of 6 or more, but the replacement is done for the entire run, and maybe there's a mistake in the example. But that's unlikely. The examples are correct as given. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nLooking at the first two examples in Example 0, the input and output are identical. So perhaps the rule is that the first two rows are left as is, and then starting from the third row, some transformation happens. But that's probably not the case. Let's check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the first two rows in the input and output are the same. The third row starts the transformation. So maybe the first two rows are not transformed, but starting from the third row, a certain rule is applied. But looking at the other examples, like Example 1, the first two rows are also identical. So the pattern is that the first two rows are unchanged, and starting from the third row, runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s. But wait, in Example 1's third input line:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nThe output has the run of 9 6s replaced with 9 4s. So that's a run of 9, which is more than 6. So the rule would be: in all rows except the first two, replace any run of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nBut in Example 0's fourth row, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and a 2. That contradicts this. Unless there's a mistake in the example. But that's unlikely. So perhaps there's another factor here.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation applies only to runs of exactly six elements. But in the third example of Example 0, the run of six 8s is replaced with six 4s, and a run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s. So that's more than six. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied only to runs of six or more, but only in certain positions. Like, maybe after a certain index in the list. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, looking back at the fourth example of Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo the run of six 8s (indices 4-9) becomes six 4s. The run of eight 2s (indices 20-27) becomes seven 4s and one 2. That's odd. Wait, maybe the run is split into two parts. Like, the first seven 2s are a run of seven, which is replaced with seven 4s, and the eighth 2 is left as is. But that would imply that the run of eight is split into seven and one, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but only if the run starts at a certain position. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six or exactly seven. But that doesn't fit with the other examples.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Looking at Example 0's fifth input line:\n\nInput: [1,3,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,8,3]\n\nOutput: [1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,3]\n\nHere, the input has a run of six 8s (indices 4-9) replaced with six 4s, and a run of seven 2s (indices 20-26) replaced with seven 4s. So that fits the pattern of replacing runs of six or more with 4s of the same length. Then why in the fourth example's case, the run of eight 2s is replaced by seven 4s and a 2? That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the fourth example's output. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fourth example:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nOutput: [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nWait, the input's 2s run is from index 20 to 27 (elements 20 to 27 inclusive). That's eight 2s. The output's elements 20 to 27 are [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. So seven 4s and one 2. That's seven elements. But eight in the input. So perhaps the output is a mistake? Or perhaps there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the run is only replaced if it's exactly six or more, but some other condition, like the number of runs in the list. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement happens for runs of six or more, but the 4s are placed starting from the first occurrence, but the last element is left as it was. But that would complicate the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace all occurrences of runs of 6 or more, but in some cases, there's an overlap with another run. But I don't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for the first six elements of a run of six or more, and the rest are left as is. But that would mean that in a run of eight, the first six are replaced with 4s, and the remaining two stay. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input line's run of eight 2s, if the first six are replaced with 4s and the remaining two left as 2s, the output would be 4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2. But the actual output is seven 4s and one 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is puzzling. Let me check other examples to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's sixth input line:\n\nInput: [8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,1,3,1,8,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8]\n\nOutput: [8,2,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,6,1,3,1,8,1,2,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,8]\n\nThe input has a run of six 8s (indices 4-9) replaced by 4s, and a run of eight 2s (indices 20-27) replaced by seven 4s and one 2. So again, eight becomes seven and one.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the replacement is for runs of 6 or more, but if the run is even-length, replace with 4s for the entire run except the last element. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any run of consecutive numbers with length >=6 is replaced with 4s, but only if the run starts after the first two elements. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of 6 or more, but the replacement starts after the third element. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to all runs of 6 or more, but in some examples, there's a mistake. But given that this is a competition puzzle, it's more likely that I'm missing the correct pattern.\n\nLet me think again. Another approach: compare all the input and output pairs where changes occur.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nRow 3 input: six 8s become six 4s; seven 2s become seven 4s.\n\nRow 4: six 8s become six 4s; eight 2s become seven 4s and a 2. This is inconsistent.\n\nRow 5: six 8s become six 4s; seven 2s become seven 4s.\n\nRow 6: six 8s become six 4s; eight 2s become seven 4s and a 2.\n\nRow 7: six 8s become six 4s.\n\nRow 12: in the output, a run of five 3s becomes four 4s and a 1. Wait, no. Let me check Row 12:\n\nInput row 12 (Example 0):\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nOutput row 12:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nThe input has a run of six 3s (indices 20-25: 3,3,3,3,3,3) replaced by six 4s. So that fits the pattern.\n\nAnother example in Example 0's row 13:\n\nInput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nOutput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nThe input has a run of six 3s (indices 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3) replaced by six 4s. But in the output, it's four 4s (indices 22-25: 4,4,4,4,4,3). Wait, the output has five 4s followed by a 3. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count:\n\nInput indices 22-27: elements are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). Output indices 22-27: 4,4,4,4,4,3. So five 4s and a 3. That's even more confusing. This breaks the pattern.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect. There must be another pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: look for other differences between input and output. In the examples where the output differs from the input, the changes are always replacing certain numbers with 4s. But what's the criteria?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced with 4s if they are part of a consecutive sequence of the same number, but only if that sequence is surrounded by certain other numbers. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in each list, after the first occurrence of a 1 followed by an 8, any consecutive sequence of six or more numbers of the same value is replaced with 4s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to every third list starting from the third one. But in Example 0, the first two are unchanged, then the next several are transformed. But in Example 1, it's the same: the first two rows are unchanged, and then starting from the third, transformations occur. So maybe the first two rows are always left as-is, and from the third row onwards, the transformation applies.\n\nSo the pattern could be:\n\nFor each list in the input:\n\n- The first two lists are left unchanged.\n\n- Starting from the third list, any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s for the entire length of the run.\n\nBut why in Example 0's fourth row, a run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and one 2? That contradicts this. Unless there's a mistake in the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to all lists except the first two, and in those lists, consecutive runs of exactly six are replaced with 4s. But that doesn't fit the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that after the first two lists, any list that contains a run of six or more identical numbers has those runs replaced with 4s. But how does that explain the fourth example's inconsistency?\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should look for a different pattern. Maybe the position in the list matters. For example, elements after a certain index are subject to replacement. Or maybe the first occurrence of a run is replaced, but not subsequent ones. Or perhaps the replacement is for runs of even length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 4s inserted depends on the length of the run. For example, runs of length >=6 are replaced with 4s, but the number of 4s is equal to the length of the run minus one. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4s are replacing the middle elements of a long run. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace the fifth consecutive occurrence and beyond with 4s. For example, if there are six consecutive numbers, the first five are kept, the sixth and beyond are replaced with 4s. But that would require checking.\n\nLet's take Example 0's third row input:\n\nThe run of six 8s: all are replaced with 4s. So if the rule is to replace all elements after the fifth, then six elements would have one element replaced. But here all six are replaced, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the rule is that runs of six or more are replaced with 4s of the same length. But then why in some cases, like the fourth example, that doesn't happen?\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the example, but assuming the examples are correct, I must find the correct pattern.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 4s are replacing runs of numbers that are part of a palindrome structure. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the sum of the numbers. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of numbers that are all the same and greater than 4. For example, 8 is replaced with 4, but 2 is also replaced with 4. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is for any run of six or more, regardless of the number. For example, if there's a run of six 2s, replace with six 4s. But in the fourth example, there's a run of eight 2s replaced with seven 4s and a 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first occurrence of a run of six or more is replaced, but subsequent runs are not. But that doesn't fit either.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be that in each list after the first two, any sequence of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced with 4s, but only if the number is even. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's third row, the runs are 8s (even) and 2s (even), replaced with 4s.\n\nFourth row: runs of 8s (even) and 2s (even). The 8s are replaced, but the 2s are partially replaced. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth row, the run of 2s is even, so why not fully replace? Maybe the even number hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's for any number, even or odd. But in Example 0's fifth row, the run is 8s (even) replaced with 4s, and 2s (even) replaced with 4s. In the sixth row, runs of 8s and 2s replaced with 4s. In the seventh row, runs of 8s replaced with 4s.\n\nBut in Example 0's row 17:\n\nInput: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nOutput: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nThe input has a run of seven 1s (indices 10-16) replaced with seven 4s. 1 is odd, but it's replaced. So the even/odd hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that, for lists after the first two, any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s, regardless of the number.\n\nBut why in Example 0's fourth row, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and a 2? Let's recheck that.\n\nInput fourth row:\n\n[1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nThe run of 2s starts at index 20 (element 21) and has eight elements. The output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. That's seven 4s and one 2. So why isn't the eighth 2 replaced?\n\nWait, perhaps the run is longer than eight, but I'm miscounting. Let's count:\n\nIndices 20-27: eight elements (positions 20 to 27 inclusive). The elements are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Eight 2s. So why in the output, only seven are replaced.\n\nThis is a problem. Unless there's a different rule here. Perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but the replacement starts at the first occurrence and covers six elements, leaving the rest. For example, in a run of eight, the first six are replaced, and the last two remain.\n\nBut in Example 0's third row, a run of six 8s is replaced with six 4s. A run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s. So that's all replaced. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six, and any longer runs are replaced up to six elements. So in a run of eight, the first six are replaced, and the remaining two are left. But in Example 0's third row, a run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six or exactly seven. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for any run of six or more, but the first six elements are replaced, and the rest are left as is. But in Example 0's third row, a run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s, which would contradict that.\n\nThis is really confusing. I must find a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLet me try to list all the transformations:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Third row: six 8s \u2192 six 4s; seven 2s \u2192 seven 4s.\n\n- Fourth row: six 8s \u2192 six 4s; eight 2s \u2192 seven 4s and a 2.\n\n- Fifth row: six 8s \u2192 six 4s; seven 2s \u2192 seven 4s.\n\n- Sixth row: six 8s \u2192 six 4s; eight 2s \u2192 seven 4s and a 2.\n\n- Seventh row: six 8s \u2192 six 4s.\n\n- Twelfth row: six 3s \u2192 six 4s.\n\n- Thirteenth row: six 3s \u2192 five 4s and a 3. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nExample 0's thirteenth row input:\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nOutput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nThe run of six 3s (indices 22-27) becomes five 4s and a 3. So only five replaced. That's strange. But the input has six 3s. So why five replaced?\n\nThis is perplexing. It seems like there's an inconsistency in the examples. But the problem states that the examples are correct and that I need to find the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s, but only if they are not the first or last elements of the list. But in Example 0's third row, the run of 8s is in the middle and replaced, but the run of 2s is at the end and also replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied only to runs that start at even indices. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs that start after a certain position. For example, indices 4 and onward. But in Example 0's fourth row, the run of 2s starts at index 20, which is even.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace every sixth occurrence in a run. For example, every sixth element becomes 4. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs where the number is even, but that doesn't fit because in Example 0's row 17, the run of 1s (odd) is replaced.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for another angle. Perhaps the position of the run within the list matters. For example, if a run is followed by a certain number, it's replaced. But that's not evident.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace all occurrences of a number that appears six or more times consecutively with 4s, but not the entire run. For example, if a number appears at least six times consecutively, replace all instances of that number in the run with 4s. But that's what I thought earlier, but the examples don't consistently show that.\n\nWait, in Example 0's fourth row, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and one 2. Maybe there's a mistake in the example. But assuming it's correct, perhaps the pattern is to replace runs of six or more with 4s, but only up to seven elements. So runs of six or seven are fully replaced, but longer runs are partially replaced. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of exactly six, and runs longer than six have their first six elements replaced. But in Example 0's third row, a run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s, which would contradict that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first occurrence of a run of six or more is replaced, but subsequent runs are not. But that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's consider that maybe the pattern is that in each list after the first two, the first run of six or more consecutive numbers is replaced with 4s, and other runs are left as is. Let's check:\n\nExample 0's third row has two runs: six 8s and seven 2s. Both are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nFourth row: two runs: six 8s and eight 2s. Both are replaced. But the second run is only partially replaced.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress here. Let's look at the test input.\n\nThe test input has multiple lists. For example, the third list in the test input is:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more. At the end, there's a run of six 1s (indices 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1). According to the pattern observed in the training examples, this run should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nAnother test input line is:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, there's a run of seven 1s (indices 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1). This should be replaced with seven 4s.\n\nAnother test input line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nThis has a run of ten 8s (indices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). According to the pattern, these would all be replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nThis has a run of six 3s (indices 12-17: 3,3,3,3,3,3) which should be replaced with 4s.\n\nAssuming the pattern is to replace any run of six or more identical numbers with 4s for the entire length, then these test cases should be transformed accordingly.\n\nBut given the inconsistency in the training examples, I'm not sure. However, the majority of the training examples show that runs of six or more are replaced entirely with 4s, so perhaps the fourth example in Example 0's training data is a typo, and the correct pattern is to replace all runs of six or more with 4s of the same length.\n\nThus, for the test input, I'll apply that pattern: for each list, after the first two, replace any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nEach of the test input lists should have their runs of six or more replaced with 4s. For example, the third test input line has a run of six 1s, which should become six 4s. The fourth line has a run of seven 1s, which becomes seven 4s. The fifth line has a run of ten 8s, which becomes ten 4s, and so on.\n\nSo the final answer should be each test input list with any runs of six or more identical numbers replaced by 4s for the entire run length, except for the first two lists which remain unchanged."
