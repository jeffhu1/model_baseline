        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this pattern. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list where some numbers are replaced with 4s. Hmm. Let me look closely.\n\nTake the first example, Example 0. The input has several rows. The output for each row seems to have some sequences of numbers replaced by 4s. Let me compare input and output rows one by one.\n\nLooking at the first input row in Example 0:\n[3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]\nThe output is the same. So maybe the first row is left as is. Similarly, the second row in input and output is the same. But starting from the third input row, there's a change. The third input row has:\n[1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\nThe output is:\n[1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\nAh, so the sequence of six 8s starting at index 4 is replaced by six 4s. Then, later, there's seven 2s starting at index 20 replaced by seven 4s. Wait, no, in the input row, from index 4, there are six 8s (positions 4-9) which in the output become 4s. Then, from index 20, there are seven 2s (positions 20-26) which become seven 4s. So the pattern seems to be replacing consecutive repeated numbers (runs) of length 6 or more with 4s. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at the fourth input row in Example 0:\n[1,3,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,8,3]\nThe output is:\n[1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,3]\nAgain, the six 8s become 4s, and the seven 2s become 4s. So it's replacing runs of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the third input row:\n[2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nThe output replaces the nine 6s starting at index 5 with 4s. So yes, runs of 6 or more same numbers are replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but looking at some other rows. In Example 0, the 8th input row:\n[3,1,3,8,3,2,3,8,1,3,1,8,1,3,1,2,3,1,8,6,2,1,3,1,1,8,3,1,6,3]\nThe output is the same. So why is this row not modified? Because there are no runs of 6 or more. Let's check. The input here has runs like 3,1,3, etc., but the longest run is maybe 2 or 3. So no replacement happens here.\n\nSo the pattern seems clear: for each row in the input, any consecutive sequence (run) of the same number that is 6 or longer is replaced with 4s for the entire length of that run. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nTesting this against all examples. For instance, in Example 0, the 13th input row:\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\nOutput becomes:\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\nHere, the six 3s starting at index 22 are replaced with six 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the third row:\n[2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nThe output replaces the nine 6s with 4s.\n\nSo the rule is: In each list, replace any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s, keeping the same length of the run. All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take the first test input row:\n\n[6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check each element sequentially:\n\n6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6.\n\nRuns:\n\n- The first element is 6 (single).\n- 8 (single).\n- Three 3s (length 3).\n- 8 (single).\n- 1 (single).\n- 8 (single).\n- 3 (single).\n- Two 8s (length 2).\n- 1 (single).\n- 6 (single).\n- 3 (single).\n- 1 (single).\n- 2 (single).\n- 3 (single).\n- Three 1s (length 3).\n- Then 3,1 (so no run here).\n- Then 2,2 (length 2).\n- Then 6,8,2,3,8,6 (all singles or pairs).\n\nSo the longest run here is 3. So no replacement. So the output row is same as input.\n\nNext test input row:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n1, then two 6s (length 2), two 8s (length 2), then 1, two 3s (length 2), 6,3, two 8s (length 2), 2, two 1s (length 2), 3,6, two 8s (length 2), 3, then 1,2,1,8,2,3, three 8s (length 3), 2. The longest run is 3. So no replacement.\n\nThird test input row:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check:\n\nFirst two 8s (length 2). Then 3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2, then six 1s (positions 20-25). So that's a run of six 1s. So this should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nSo the output row should have 4s from index 20 to 25.\n\nFourth test input row:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. Check the sequence of 1s starting at position 20. From index 20: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1. That's seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo output row will have 4s from index 20 to 26.\n\nAnother test row: the fifth row in test input:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s starting at index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's nine 8s. So replace with 4s. Then, after that, the 1s starting at index 19: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). Replace those with 4s. So in this row, two runs are replaced.\n\nAnother example: the sixth test row:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s starting at index 6: eight 8s (from 6 to 15, maybe more). Let's count: positions 6-15 are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (that's 10 8s). So replace with 4s. Then the 1s at positions 16-17 (two 1s), then later 1s from 21 to 25: five 1s (not enough). Then 6, 2, 8, 3. So only the ten 8s are replaced by 4s.\n\nAnother test row: seventh input row:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The first four 3s (length 4, so no). Then 8 at position 4. Then a single 3. Then eight 8s (positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8? Wait, let's check:\n\nInput row: 3,3,3,3,8,3, then starting at index 5: 8, then at index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-13: 8s, but maybe the count is 8? Wait, let me count:\n\nOriginal array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nIndices 0-3: four 3s.\n\nIndex4: 8\n\nIndex5:3\n\nIndices6-15: 8 (position6), then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions6-15, which is 10 elements, so 10 8s). So that's a run of 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at positions 24-29: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), so that's another run of six 8s. So both runs would be replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the output for this row would have 4s from 6-15 and 24-29.\n\nSo applying this rule to each test input row: check for consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers, replace each such run with 4s of the same length. All other numbers stay the same.\n\nNow, let's process each test input row as per this pattern."
