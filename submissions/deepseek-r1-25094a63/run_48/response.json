        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output lists. The outputs have some numbers replaced with 4s. Let me compare the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has a sequence like [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, ...], and the output replaces the six 8s with four 4s. Wait, wait, the output shows [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, ...]. So, six consecutive 8s are replaced by six 4s. Similarly, in another part of the same example, the input has seven 2s, and the output replaces them with seven 4s. \n\nWait, but in the first example's third input line, the output for the part starting at index 4 is replacing six 8s with 4s. So maybe the rule is that whenever there's a consecutive run of the same number, and the length is 6 or more, those are replaced by 4s? Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at the second example in Example 0's input: [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]. The output here doesn't have any 4s. So maybe that sequence doesn't have consecutive numbers of 6 or more. Let me check. The input here doesn't have long runs. \n\nIn the third input line of Example 0, the input has [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, ...]. Here, the 8s are six in a row. The output changes those to 4s. Similarly, in the fourth input line of Example 0, there's a run of six 8s again, replaced by 4s. So the pattern seems to be replacing runs of exactly six identical numbers with 4s. But wait, some of the outputs in the examples have runs of 4s longer than six. Wait, no. Let me check. For instance, in Example 0's output, the third line has seven 4s. Wait, no. Let me recount. The input had six 8s, and the output has six 4s. So the replacement is same length. So the rule is: any consecutive run of exactly six identical numbers is replaced by six 4s. Wait, but in the first example's first input line, the output didn't change the first few elements. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the first input line of Example 0, the input starts with [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]. The output is the same as the input. So there's a run of three 8s here, which is less than six, so no replacement. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive run of exactly six of the same number is replaced by 4s. Let me check other parts.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third line has a run of six 8s. The output replaces them with six 4s. Similarly, in another line, a run of seven 2s becomes seven 4s. Wait, in the third input line of Example 0, the input has a part like 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (seven 2s). The output replaces them with seven 4s. Wait, but the example's output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4. So seven 4s. So the rule might be that any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced by 4s, but in the same quantity as the original run. Wait, but in the first example's first input line, the output is the same as the input, meaning no runs of six or more. So the pattern is: replace any consecutive sequence of exactly six identical numbers with six 4s. Wait, but in Example 0's third line, the run is seven 2s, and they are replaced by seven 4s. So perhaps the rule is that any run of six or more consecutive numbers is replaced by 4s. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a line like [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,...]. The output for that part is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So nine 6s in input become nine 4s in output. So this suggests that any run of six or more same numbers is replaced by 4s, with the same length as the original run.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's third input line: the seven 2s become seven 4s. So the rule is, wherever there's a consecutive run of six or more of the same number, replace each element in that run with 4. So the length of the run is preserved, but the numbers become 4s.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with the other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first line is [6,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,3,8,6,2,3,8,1,2,8,1,3,8,3,3,6,6,1,2,6,2,2]. The output is the same. Looking for runs of 6 or more. The first part has four 8s in a row (positions 3-6). So that's four, which is less than six, so no replacement. The rest don't have runs of six. So output matches input.\n\nAnother line in Example 1's input: [8,6,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,1,1,2,1,2,6,8,2,6,2,1,8,3,3,8]. The run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. So the output line starts with [8,6,8,2,3,4,4,...] etc. So yes, the 6s are replaced with 4s, same length.\n\nSo the pattern is: For any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each element in that run with 4. The length of the run remains the same; only the number is changed to 4.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at each array and check for runs of six or more same numbers.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n\n[6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs of the same number. Let's check each element:\n\n6, then 8, then three 3s, then 8, then 1, etc. The longest run here is three 3s. No runs of six or more. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nSecond test input array:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's see: two 6s, two 8s, two 3s, two 8s, etc. The longest run is three 8s at the end. No runs of six. So this remains the same.\n\nThird test input array:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The part starting at index 20: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]. That's six 1s in a row. So this run of six 1s should be replaced by six 4s. So the output for this array would have 4s there.\n\nFourth test input array:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The part starting at index 20: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Seven 1s. So this should be replaced by seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The part starting at index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's ten 8s. So this run of ten should become ten 4s. Then later, after index 19: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1. Seven 1s. Also replaced by 4s. The part at the end: 8,3,6,8: no runs.\n\nSo in this array, the two runs (ten 8s and seven 1s) become 4s.\n\nSixth test input array:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nRun starting at index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at index 20: 1,1,1,1,1. Five 1s. Not enough. Then after that, 6, then 2, etc. So the long run of 8s becomes 4s.\n\nContinuing this process for each test input array. For each array, check consecutive numbers. Whenever there's a run of 6 or more same numbers, replace each element in that run with 4. The rest remain the same.\n\nSo applying this pattern to the test input should generate the correct output."
