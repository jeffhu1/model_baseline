        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input and output arrays are mostly the same, but some elements are replaced with 4s. Let me check where those 4s are. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nI notice that a sequence of consecutive 8s in the input (from index 4 to 9) is replaced with 4s in the output. Similarly, the consecutive 2s starting at index 20 (seven 2s) are replaced with 4s. So it seems like whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, they are replaced with 4s. Wait, let me check another example to confirm.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input array:\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere again, the six 8s at positions 4-9 become 4s, and the seven 2s starting at index 20 become 4s. So the pattern seems to be that any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s. Let me check if that's consistent in other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. For instance, the third input array in Example 1:\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, there's a run of nine 6s starting at index 5, replaced by 4s. The same applies to other instances. So the rule appears to be that whenever there are six or more consecutive identical elements in the input array, they are replaced with 4s in the output. The other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's verify with the test input. Let's take each of the test input arrays and check for runs of six or more same numbers.\n\nFirst test input array:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nLooking for consecutive runs. The 3,3,3 at the start is only three in a row. There's a 8,8 in index 9 and 10. No six in a row. So no changes here. So this array remains the same.\n\nSecond test input array:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nAgain, check for consecutive runs. The 8,8,8 at the end (indices 26-28) is three in a row. No runs of six. So unchanged.\n\nThird test array:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nHere, indices 21-26 are six 1s. So this run should be replaced with 4s. So from position 21 to 26 (six elements), replace each with 4.\n\nFourth test array:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nLooking at indices 20-26: seven 1s. So replace those seven 1s with 4s.\n\nFifth test array:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nStarting from index 6: a run of 8s from 6 to 15 (10 elements). That's ten 8s. So replace all of them with 4s. Then, indices 20-26: seven 1s. Replace those with 4s as well.\n\nWait, but the pattern in the training examples replaces the entire run with 4s, regardless of length as long as it's six or more. So for example, if a run is 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six elements), all become 4s. If longer, like 10 elements, all become 4s. So in the fifth test array, the 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) become 4s. Similarly, the 1s from 20 to 26 (7 elements) become 4s.\n\nLet me check the sixth test input array:\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\nHere, the 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) become 4s. Then the 1s from 20 to 24 (five elements) are only five, so no change. The next 1s from 22-26? Wait, maybe I need to recount. Let's see: index 20 is 6, 21 is 1, 22 is 1, 23 is 1, 24 is 1, 25 is 1. That's five 1s (positions 21-25). So no replacement here. But at the end, there's a 6, 2, 8, 3, which are unchanged.\n\nNext array:\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\nThe first four 3s (indices 0-3) are four in a row. Not six. Then the 8s starting at index 4: 8 at 4, then 8s from 6 to 15. Let's see: index 4 is 8, then index 5 is 3, so the 8s start at 6. From 6 to 15 (indices 6-15) are 10 8s. So replace those with 4s. Then, at the end, 8s from 22-27 (6 elements), so replace those with 4s as well.\n\nWait, let's clarify the exact positions. In the seventh test input array:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nThe 8s start at index 6. From 6 to 15 (inclusive) that's 10 elements. Then index 16 is 8 again. So total from 6 to 16 is 11 8s. So all of them are replaced with 4s. Then there's 8,8,8 at indices 25-27, which is three, so no change. Wait, but the original array is:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nSo indices 6 to 16 (11 elements) are all 8s. So replace all with 4s. Then the 8s at 25-27 (three) stay as 8s.\n\nAnother test array:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nHere, the 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) become 4s. Then after that, there's a 6, then three 8s (indices 17-19) which is three, so no change.\n\nContinuing this process for all test arrays. The key is to check each array for runs of six or more identical numbers and replace each element in those runs with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nSo, applying this to each test array:\n\nFor example, the third test input array:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nIndices 21-26 (assuming 0-based) are six 1s. So replace those six 1s with 4s.\n\nSo the output array would have 4s in positions 21-26.\n\nAnother example, the fifth test array:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) become 4s, and the 1s from 20 to 26 (7 elements) become 4s.\n\nSo the transformed array would have 4s in those ranges.\n\nLet me confirm this with the training examples. For instance, in the first example, the third array had a run of six 8s starting at index 4, replaced by six 4s. Similarly, a run of seven 2s became seven 4s.\n\nTherefore, the rule is solid. Now, applying this to all test input arrays.\n\nEach array in the test input needs to be processed by replacing any consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers with 4s. Let's go through each test array:\n\n1. First test array: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n   No runs of 6 or more. So output same as input.\n\n2. Second array: [1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n   No runs of 6. Output same.\n\n3. Third array: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n   Indices 21-26 (six 1s) \u2192 replace with 4s. So positions 21 to 26 become 4s.\n\n4. Fourth array: [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n   Indices 20-26 (seven 1s) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\n5. Fifth array: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n   The 8s from 6-15 (10 elements) \u2192 4s. The 1s from 20-26 (7 elements) \u2192 4s.\n\n6. Sixth array: [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n   The 8s from 6-15 (10 elements) \u2192 4s. The 1s from 21-25 (five elements) \u2192 no change.\n\n7. Seventh array: [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n   The 8s from 6-15 (10 elements) \u2192 4s. The 8s from 22-27 (six elements) \u2192 4s.\n\nWait, in the seventh array's input, the 8s at 6-15 are ten 8s, and then after that, the array has 1,3,1,1,6,2, then 8,8,8,8,8,8 (indices 22-27), which is six 8s. So both runs are replaced with 4s.\n\n8. Eighth array: [3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n   The 8s from 6-16 (11 elements) \u2192 4s. The three 8s at 25-27 remain.\n\n9. Ninth array: [1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n   The 8s from 6-15 (10 elements) \u2192 4s. The three 8s at 17-19 remain.\n\n10. Tenth array: [8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\n    The 8s from 6-15 (10 elements) \u2192 4s. The three 8s at 26-28 remain.\n\n11. Eleventh array: [3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\n    The 8s from 6-15 (10 elements) \u2192 4s. Also, the 8s from 5-15? Wait, the array starts with 3,3,1,1,2,8, followed by 8s up to index 15. So from index 5 to 15 (11 elements) all 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\n12. Twelfth array: [6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\n    Check for runs. The 2s at the end (indices 27-29) are three, no change. No runs of six. So output same.\n\n13. Thirteenth array: [1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 6]\n    The 2s from 10-13 (four elements), 3s from 14-16 (three). No runs of six. Output same.\n\n14. Fourteenth array: [8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\n    No runs of six. Output same.\n\n15. Fifteenth array: [8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 6, 1, 1, 3]\n    Check for runs. 8s at 0-1 (two), 8s at 18-20 (three). 3s at 21-23 (three). No six. So no change.\n\n16. Sixteenth array: [6, 8, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6]\n    No runs of six. So output same.\n\n17. Seventeenth array: [3, 8, 1, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 1]\n    Check for runs. 8s at 21-23 (three). No six. So no change.\n\n18. Eighteenth array: [8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 6, 1]\n    Check for runs. No sequences of six. So same.\n\n19. Nineteenth array: [3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 8]\n    Check for runs. 3s at 4-5 (two), 3s at 6-7 (two). No six. So same.\n\n20. Twentieth array: [8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\n    The 3s from 10-19: 10 elements (indices 10-19 are ten 3s). So replace those with 4s.\n\nWait, let's check the exact indices. The array is:\n\n[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nLooking at the 3s: starting at index 10 (3), then 11-13 (three more 3s), index 14 is 6. Then from 15 to 20: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). So indices 15-20 (six elements) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nSo in this array, the six 3s from 15-20 become 4s.\n\n21. Twenty-first array: [6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n    The 3s from 16-21 (six elements) \u2192 replace with 4s. Wait, indices 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3. So six 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\n22. Twenty-second array: [8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n    The 3s from 16-22 (seven elements) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\n23. Twenty-third array: [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n    The 3s from 16-21 (six elements) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\n24. Twenty-fourth array: [1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\n    The 3s from 16-22 (seven elements) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\n25. Twenty-fifth array: [1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\n    The 3s from 16-22 (seven elements) \u2192 replace with 4s. Also, the 3s from 24-25 (two) remain.\n\n26. Twenty-sixth array: [8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\n    The 2s from 5-8 (four elements). The 3s from 13-20 (eight elements) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\n27. Twenty-seventh array: [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n    The 3s from 7-11 (five elements). The 3s from 13-17 (five elements). No six. So no changes.\n\n28. Twenty-eighth array: [6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\n    The 8s from 8-11 (four elements). No six. So same.\n\n29. Twenty-ninth array: [1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\n    The 3s from 6-9 (four elements). No six. Same.\n\n30. Thirtieth array: [8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n    Check for runs. 8s at 7-8 (two). 3s at 27-29 (three). No six. Same.\n\nSo for each test array, we need to apply the rule and replace runs of six or more same numbers with 4s. All others stay the same. \n\nNow, constructing the output arrays by applying this rule to each test input array. Each array in the test input will have some 4s if there are runs of six or more. The rest remain as in the input.\n\nThe final answer will be the test input arrays with the appropriate replacements."
