        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input and output arrays look very similar, but some elements are replaced with 4s. Let me compare the input and output for each array in the example. \n\nTake the third array in Example 0's input:\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nNoticing that a sequence of 8s (positions 4-9) are replaced with 4s, and the 2s from positions 20-26 are also replaced with 4s. Wait, but the input for that part is all 2s. Similarly, looking at other arrays in the example, it seems that consecutive repeated numbers are being replaced with 4s. But maybe there's a specific condition. \n\nLooking at another example, let's take the first input array in Example 0. The input and output are the same. So why wasn't any part replaced here? Let's check. The first array's input has sequences like three 8s, but in the output, they remain. So maybe the replacement isn't for all consecutive numbers. Maybe there's a specific length. \n\nWait, in the third array input, the 8s are 6 in a row (from index 4 to 9: six 8s). The output replaces those six 8s with six 4s. Similarly, the next part has seven 2s (from index 20 to 26), which becomes seven 4s. So perhaps any run of 6 or more identical numbers gets replaced with 4s for the entire run. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at the second array in Example 0's input:\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the six 8s starting at index 4 are replaced with six 4s. Then the seven 2s starting at index 20 are replaced with seven 4s. So yes, it seems that sequences of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers are replaced with 4s. Let's check another example to confirm.\n\nIn Example 1, take the third input array:\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, there's a sequence of nine 6s starting at index 5. These are replaced with nine 4s. So the pattern seems consistent: whenever there's a run of 6 or more of the same number, replace all elements in that run with 4s. If the run is shorter than 6, leave them as is. \n\nNow, looking back at the first array in Example 0's input: the input is [3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, ...]. The 8s here are three in a row, which is less than 6, so they stay. Similarly, the 3s in the input are sequences of 3, 5, etc., which are under 6. So that's why the first array's input and output are the same. \n\nSo the rule is: For any consecutive sequence of the same number that's 6 or longer, replace all elements in that sequence with 4s. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each array in the test input and replace any runs of 6+ same numbers with 4s.\n\nLooking at the Test Input arrays:\n\nFirst array: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nCheck for runs of 6. Let's scan through:\n\n6,8,3,3,3,8 (no run), then 1,8,3,8,8,1 (no run). The next parts: 3,1,1,1 is only 3, so no. No runs of 6 here. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nSecond array: [1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nCheck for runs. The first elements are 1, then 6,6 (2), 8,8 (2), etc. No runs of 6. So this array stays the same.\n\nThird array: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking at the part starting at index 20: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]. That's six 1s. So from index 21 to 26, six 1s. These should be replaced with six 4s. So positions 21-26 become 4s.\n\nFourth array: [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nCheck for runs. Starting at index 20: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So replace from index 20-26 with 4s. So seven 4s here.\n\nFifth array: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nLooking at the sequence starting at index 6: 8, then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (from index 6 to 15: 10 8s). That's a run of 10, so replace with 4s. Then, starting at index 20: seven 1s (index 20-26). Replace those with 4s. So positions 6-15 become 4s (10 elements), and 20-26 (7 elements) become 4s.\n\nSixth array: [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\nFrom index 6: 8,8,... up to index 15 (positions 6-15: 10 8s). Replace with 4s. Then, after 1,1 (positions 16-17), later at index 21-25: five 1s (only five, which is less than six), so no. Then a 6, but no. The run of 8s is 10, so replaced. \n\nSeventh array: [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\nCheck for runs. The first four 3s (index 0-3: four 3s) \u2192 no. Then 8 at index4, 3 at 5. Then from index6 to 15: 8s. Let's count: positions 6-15 (inclusive) is 10 elements. So replace those 8s with 4s. Then, from index22 to 27: six 8s. Replace those with 4s.\n\nEighth array: [3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\nStarting at index6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-16: 11 8s). Replace with 4s. Then at the end, three 8s \u2192 no change.\n\nNinth array: [1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\nFrom index6 to 15: 8s (10 elements) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then later, 8,8,8 (index17-19: three 8s) \u2192 no.\n\nTenth array: [8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\nFrom index6 to 15: 8s (10 elements) \u2192 replace with 4s. The ending 8,8,8 is three \u2192 no.\n\nEleventh array: [3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\nFrom index5 to 14: 8s (10 elements). Replace with 4s. Also, in positions 25-27: three 1s \u2192 no.\n\nTwelfth array: [6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\nLooking for runs. The 2s at positions 9-10: two. 3,3 at 20-21: two. 2,2,2 at end: three. No runs of six. So no changes.\n\nThirteenth array: [1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 6]\nCheck for runs. The 2,2,2,2 (positions 10-13: four 2s).

Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth array: [1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\nCheck. From index16 to 22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth array: [8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\nCheck. The 3s from index13 to 20: eight 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh array: [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\nCheck. 3s from index13 to 17: five 3s \u2192 no. Then 3,3,3,3,3 (positions13-17 are five). Then index18 is 6. So no runs of six here.\n\nTwenty-eighth array: [6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\nCheck. 8,8,8,8 (positions8-11: four). No six. So no change.\n\nTwenty-ninth array: [1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\nCheck. 3,3,3,3 at positions6-9: four. No six.\n\nThirtieth array: [8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\nCheck. 3,3,3 at the end (positions27-29: three). No.\n\nSo, after identifying all the runs of six or more in each test array, replace them with 4s. Then, the outputs should reflect those changes. Now, applying this to each array in the test input and replacing the relevant sequences with 4s."
