        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The training examples show input lists and output lists. Looking at Example 0, the input and output are the same for the first two lines, but starting from the third line, some numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me check the third input and output.\n\nOriginal input line 3 in Example 0:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput line 3:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, so the 8s in the middle (positions 4-9) are replaced with 4s, and the 2s from positions 20-26 are also replaced with 4s. Wait, but the count here. Let's see. The input has 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) starting at position 4. Then the output replaces those six 8s with 4s. Similarly, the 2s from position 20: the input has seven 2s in a row, and the output replaces them with seven 4s.\n\nLooking at another line in Example 0, say line 4:\n\nInput:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the 8s from positions 4-9 (six elements) replaced by 4s, and the seven 2s from positions 20-26 replaced by 4s, except the last 2 becomes a 2. Wait, maybe it's consecutive runs of 6 or more of the same number? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third input line, there's a run of six 8s and a run of seven 2s. Both are replaced with 4s. The fourth line input has six 8s and seven 2s. Both runs are replaced with 4s. So the pattern might be: replace any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number with 4s, keeping the same length. Let me verify with other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Take the third input line:\n\nInput:\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, there's a run of nine 6s starting at position 5. These are replaced with nine 4s. So it's replacing runs of 6 or more of the same number with 4s, regardless of what the original number was. That seems consistent.\n\nAnother example in Example 1's input line 17:\n\nInput:\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nOutput:\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nHere, the seven 8s starting at position 13 are replaced with seven 4s.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each list, any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take the test input line by line and check for runs of 6 or more same numbers.\n\nTest Input line 4:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking at this line. Starting from position 6 (0-based index), there's a run of '8's. Let's count: positions 6-15 (inclusive) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 8s. So replace them with 10 4s.\n\nAnother part: positions 20-26 are seven 1s. Replace with 4s.\n\nSo the output line would be:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nWait, but the original part after the 10 8s is 1,3,8,1, then the seven 1s. Let me count again.\n\nOriginal line 4:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:8, 5:6, then indices 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s). Then index 16:1, 17:3, 18:8, 19:1. Then indices 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (7 1s). Then index 27:8, 28:3, 29:6, 30:8 (wait, the test input line 4 is given as length 30? Let me check.\n\nWait, the test input has 30 elements per line. Let me recount the test input line 4:\n\nLine 4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nYes, exactly 30 elements. So indices 6-15: 10 8s. Then indices 20-26: 7 1s. So in the output, those runs are replaced by 4s. So the output line 4 would start as [8,1,2,3,8,6, followed by 10 4s, then 1,3,8,1, followed by 7 4s, then 8,3,6,8].\n\nAnother example: test input line 5:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The 8s from index 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at index 20-24: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (6 1s). So replace those six 1s with 4s. So output would have 4s there.\n\nAnother test line: line 6:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nHere, the 8s from index 6 to 15 are 10 8s. Then 8s from 22 to 27: 6 8s. Both replaced with 4s. So those parts become 4s.\n\nSo the rule is: for each consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each element in the run with 4. Keep other numbers as they are.\n\nNow, applying this to each line of the test input. Let's process each line:\n\nTest Input Line 0: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nCheck for runs of 6 or more same numbers. Let's see:\n\nLooking at each element:\n\n3,3,3: only 3 in a row. Then 8,3,8,8: no. 1,1,1: three. Then 2,2: two. So no runs of 6. So this line remains unchanged.\n\nSimilarly, the next lines. Let's take line 3 of the test input:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nHere, the run of seven 1s starting at index 20 (positions 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1) which is seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo the output line 3 would have 4s there.\n\nAnother line, line 4 of test input:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nAs before, replace the 10 8s (indices 6-15) with 4s, and the seven 1s (indices 20-26) with 4s.\n\nSo each line needs to be checked for consecutive runs of 6+ same numbers, replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo now, the final answer will be the test input lines, with any runs of 6 or more same numbers replaced by 4s."
