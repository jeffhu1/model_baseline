        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples so I can apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the first two lines are the same in the output. But the third line in the input is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3], and the output changes the middle consecutive 8s and 2s into 4s. Specifically, from index 4 to 9 (positions 5th to 10th elements), the 8s become 4s. Then from index 20 to 26 (positions 21st to 27th), the 2s become 4s. Wait, but the output shows those sections as 4s. So maybe the pattern is replacing sequences of the same number (like six 8s or seven 2s) with 4s? But how long do the sequences need to be?\n\nLooking at other lines in Example 0. The fourth input line has eight 8s. In the output, they're replaced with 4s. So maybe whenever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, it gets replaced with 4s of the same length? Let me check another example. In Example 0's input line 5: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]. The output has six 8s replaced with six 4s and eight 2s replaced with eight 4s. So yes, runs of 6 or more same numbers become 4s. But wait, in the first input line of Example 0, the input has three 8s, which are left as 8s. So the threshold is runs of 6 or longer.\n\nLooking at Example 1. The third input line is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. The output replaces the sequence of nine 6s starting at index 5 with nine 4s. So again, runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in each list of the input, any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 6 or more in length is replaced with the number 4, repeated the same number of times. All other elements remain the same.\n\nTesting this against the training examples. Let's take another line. In Example 0's input line 12: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]. The output has [3,3,3,3,3,3] replaced with 4s. That's six 3s, so replaced with six 4s. Yes. \n\nAnother example in Example 0's input line 17: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]. The input has seven 1s (positions 10-16), which in the output become seven 4s. \n\nSo the rule is confirmed: replace any run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each list in the test input:\n\nLooking at the first test input line:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nCheck for consecutive runs of 6 or more. Let's go through each element:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three in a row \u2192 no\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three \u2192 no\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two \u2192 no\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo sequences of 6 here. So output is same as input.\n\nSecond test input line:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nCheck for sequences. Let's see:\n\n1 \u2192 1, then 6,6 (two), 8,8 (two), 1, then 3,3 (two), etc. The only possible longer run is at the end: 8,8,8 (three). So no 6-length runs. So output same.\n\nThird test line:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking for runs. The 1s from index 21 to 26 (positions 22-27): six 1s. So replace those six with 4s. So the output for this line will have [1,1,1,1,1,1] replaced with [4,4,4,4,4,4].\n\nFourth test line:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nCheck for runs. The 1s at positions 20-26 (indices 20-26) are seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test line:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nCheck. The sequence starting at index 6 (element 7) is 8, followed by 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 9 8s. So replace with nine 4s. Then later, there's seven 1s (indices 19-25: elements 20-26), which is seven \u2192 replace with seven 4s. So this line would have two replaced sections.\n\nSixth test line:\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\nCheck. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (elements 7-16) are 10 in a row. Replace with 10 4s. Then six 1s from index 21-26 (elements 22-27) \u2192 replace with six 4s.\n\nSeventh test line:\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\nCheck. The 3s at the start: four 3s \u2192 no. Then 8s from index 6 to 15 (elements 7-16): 10 8s \u2192 replace.

The 8s from index 6 to 16 (elements 7-17): 11 8s \u2192 replace with 11 4s.\n\nNinth test line:\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\nCheck. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (elements 7-16): 10 8s \u2192 replaced.

Then 3,3,3,3,3 (elements 15-19): five \u2192 no. Wait, the line here is [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]. The 3s at positions 13-17 (elements 14-18: indices 13,14,15,16,17) are five 3s. Then 6,8, etc. So no replacement here.\n\nTwenty-eighth test line:\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\nCheck. 8,8,8,8 (four) \u2192 no. 3,3,3 (three) \u2192 no.\n\nTwenty-ninth test line:\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\nCheck. 3,3,3,3 (four) \u2192 no.\n\nThirtieth test line:\n[8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\nCheck. 3,3,3 at end \u2192 three \u2192 no.\n\nSo applying the rule to each line of the test input, replacing any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers with 4s. Now, the final outputs would be the test input lines with those substitutions."
