        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially comparing the input and output arrays. \n\nFirst, in Example 0, the input arrays have sequences of numbers, and the outputs replace some of those sequences with 4s. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0, the input starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, ...], and the output is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, ...]. So the six 8s in a row got replaced by six 4s. Similarly, later in the same array, there's a sequence of seven 2s that become seven 4s. \n\nLooking at another example, like the fourth input array in Example 0: the input has [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] which becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4]. So whenever there's a run of the same number longer than a certain length, maybe 5 or more, they get replaced by 4s? Wait, but in some cases, like the first array of Example 0, there's a run of three 8s (positions 5-7) that remain 8s. So maybe the threshold is 6 or more? Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third input array, the run of six 8s becomes six 4s. Another example in the same input: in the third array, after the first part, there's a run of seven 2s which become seven 4s. So perhaps the rule is that any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers gets replaced by the same number of 4s. Let me verify this across the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input array has a run of nine 6s (positions 5-13) which are replaced by nine 4s in the output. Another example in the same input: the third array's input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,...], and the output replaces the nine 6s with nine 4s. So yes, whenever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, it's replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's second array (the second input), there's a part where the input is [8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]. The output here doesn't have any 4s. So maybe the threshold is exactly 6? Let's check that array. Are there any runs of 6? Let's see: in the input, the third array of Example 0's input is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]. The run of 8s from position 4 to 9 (six 8s) becomes 4s. Then, starting at position 20, there are seven 2s (positions 20-26) which become seven 4s. So runs of exactly 6 or more are replaced. So the rule is: any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input, there's a run of seven 6s (positions 5-11 in the third input array) which become 4s. So the pattern holds. \n\nSo the transformation is: in the input array, wherever there are 6 or more consecutive identical numbers, replace each of those numbers with a 4. All other numbers remain the same. \n\nNow, let's check the test input. The test input has several arrays. Let's take the first test input array: \n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's scan through:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three 3s \u2192 no\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three \u2192 no\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two \u2192 no\n- 6,8,2,3,8,6: all singles.\n\nSo in this array, there's no run of 6 or more. So output remains same.\n\nNext test array:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs of 6+:\n\n- 6,6: two \u2192 no\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 3,3: two \u2192 no\n- 8,8: two \u2192 no\n- 8,8,8: three \u2192 no. So no runs here. So output same.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Here, positions 20-25 (assuming 0-based) have six 1s. From index 20 to 25 (inclusive) in the array: let's count. The array is:\n\nindex 20: 1, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1 \u2192 six 1s. So this sequence should be replaced by six 4s. So the output array here would have 4s there.\n\nSo the third test array's output would have [..., 1, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3, 6].\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's see. From index 20 to 26 (assuming 0-based) we have seven 1s. So that's a run of seven, which should be replaced by 4s. So positions 20-26 (seven elements) become seven 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would have [..., 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3].\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nCheck for runs. The sequence starting at index 6 (8) through index 15 (8) is a run of 10 8s. So replace all with 4s. Then, at index 19-25 (assuming 0-based), there are seven 1s. So those become 4s. So the output would have 4s from index 6-15 (10 elements) and 4s from 19-25 (7 elements).\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nWait, but the first run starts at 6 (assuming index 0). Let me count:\n\nOriginal array elements from index 6 onward:\n\nOriginal array: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nFrom index 6 (element 8) to 15 (element 8) is 10 elements (positions 6-15 inclusive). All 8s. So replaced by 4s. Then, from index 19 (element 1) to 25 (element 1) is 7 elements. So those become 4s. So the output array would have those sections as 4s.\n\nContinuing this process for all test input arrays, replacing any consecutive runs of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length. All other numbers stay the same.\n\nSo applying this to each array in the test input, checking each for runs of 6+ same numbers and replacing them with 4s.\n\nNow, the test input has several arrays. Let's go through each:\n\nTest Input array 3:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nIn this array, there's a run of seven 1s starting at index 20 (assuming the array is 0-based). Wait, let's count the elements:\n\nIndices 0-29:\n\nLooking at the array:\n\nIndices 20-26: elements at positions 20 to 26: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (seven 1s). So replaced by 4s.\n\nSo from index 20 to 26 (7 elements), replace with 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nFrom index 6 to 15 (elements 8,8,... 8) \u2192 10 8s \u2192 replaced by 4s.\n\nFrom index 19 to 25 (elements 1,1,1,1,1,1,1) \u2192 seven 1s \u2192 replaced by 4s.\n\nAnother example in the test input:\n\nTest array 7:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nHere, the run from index 6 to 16 (elements 8s, 11 elements) \u2192 replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the output array would have 4s in those positions.\n\nSo applying this to all test arrays and replacing any run of 6+ same numbers with 4s. The rest stay as is."
