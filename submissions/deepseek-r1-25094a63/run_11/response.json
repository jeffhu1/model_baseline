        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Let me start by carefully examining the examples to spot any consistent changes.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output have the same elements except in certain positions where numbers are replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0, the input starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...], and the output becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...]. Similarly, other lists in the example show sequences of 8s or other numbers being replaced by 4s in consecutive positions. The same applies to Example 1, where 6s in a row are replaced by 4s. \n\nWait, in Example 1, the third input list has [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, ...] and the output changes the consecutive 6s to 4s. So the pattern seems to be replacing runs of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s. Let me check more examples to confirm.\n\nIn Example 0, the first two input lists don't have any consecutive numbers of 6 or more, so they remain unchanged. The third input has a run of six 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9), which are replaced by six 4s. Similarly, other lists in Example 0 that have runs of 6 or more same numbers are replaced by 4s. For example, in the third list of the output in Example 0, after the 4s, there's a run of seven 2s starting at position 20 (indices 20-26), which become seven 4s. Wait, but in that case, the original numbers were 2s. So maybe any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, let's take another example. In Example 0's input list 2: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,...]. The output replaces the six 8s (positions 4-9) with six 4s. Then later in the same list, there are seven 2s starting at index 20. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So regardless of the original number, as long as there's a run of 6 or more, it becomes 4s. \n\nIn Example 1's first test list, the third input list has a run of nine 6s (positions 5-13), which are replaced by nine 4s. Another list in Example 1's input has a run of eight 8s (positions 13-20 in the 18th input list?), which are replaced by 4s. So the pattern is: in each list, wherever there are six or more consecutive identical numbers, replace each of those numbers with a 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input lists and check for runs of 6 or more same numbers. Let's go through each list one by one.\n\nFirst test input list: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. I don't see any runs of 6 here. The longest runs are three 3s, three 8s, etc. So this list remains unchanged.\n\nSecond test list: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. The longest run is three 8s at the end. No 6 or longer. So unchanged.\n\nThird test list: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, there's a run of six 1s starting at index 21 (positions 21-26). These should be replaced by six 4s. The rest remain the same. So the output for this list would have 4s there.\n\nFourth test list: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. Here, starting at index 20 (positions 20-26), there's a run of seven 1s. So these become 4s.\n\nFifth test list: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The run here is from index 6 to 15 (positions 6-15), which is 10 8s. These are replaced by 4s. Then, from index 20-26 (positions 20-26), seven 1s, which also become 4s. So this list will have two segments of 4s.\n\nSixth test list: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The run of 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 8s) becomes 4s. The run of five 1s from index 17-21 (positions 17-21) is only five, so no replacement. Then, the run from index 21-25 (positions 21-25) is five 1s again. But wait, the input here is [1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's see the exact list:\n\nSixth test input list:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nFrom index 6 (0-based), the 8s start at position 6 (value 8) and go up to position 15 (inclusive). That's 10 elements (6-15), all 8s. So replaced by 4s. Then, after that, the 1s at positions 16-17 are two, then a 3, 1, 6, then positions 21-25 (1s, five in a row). So that's five 1s. Since five is less than six, they stay. The run at the end is six? Wait, positions 21-25 are five 1s (indices 21,22,23,24,25). So five, so no replacement. So in this list, only the 10 8s are replaced by 4s.\n\nSeventh test list: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. Let's check. From position 0-3: four 3s. Then position 4:8, position5:3. Then from position6 to 15: 8s. That's 10 8s (positions6-15). Then after that, other elements. So the 8s in positions6-15 are replaced by 4s. Then, at positions22-27: 8s again (positions 22-27 are 6 elements: positions 22,23,24,25,26,27?), but let's check the list. The list after index 15 is 1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3. So starting at position 22 (the first 8 after 6,2) would be positions 22-27: 6 elements of 8s. So six 8s, which should be replaced by 4s. So in this list, two segments of 4s: positions6-15 (10 4s) and positions22-27 (6 4s).\n\nEighth test list: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The run of 8s here starts at position6 (0-based) and goes to position15, which is 10 8s. Then position16 is another 8, making it 11 8s in a row. So all those 11 positions (indices6-16) would be replaced by 4s.\n\nContinuing this way for all test input lists. For each list, check every consecutive sequence. If the length is 6 or more, replace each element in the sequence with 4. All other elements stay the same.\n\nSo the final answer will be the test input lists with any runs of 6 or more same numbers converted to 4s in those positions."
