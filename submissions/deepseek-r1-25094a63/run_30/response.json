        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of numbers and the output is another list. The first thing I notice is that in some of the outputs, there are sequences of the number 4 replacing certain parts of the input. For example, in Example 0, the third input list starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...] and the output becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...]. So the consecutive 8s are replaced by 4s. But wait, how many 8s are there? Let's count. From the fifth element (index 4) there are six 8s. The output replaces those six 8s with six 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the third input list has a sequence of six 6s starting at index 5, and the output replaces them with 4s. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, those are replaced by 4s. But wait, in some cases, even runs longer than six are replaced. For instance, in Example 0's third input, there are seven 8s in a row. The output replaces all of them with six 4s. Wait, no\u2014the input has eight 8s? Let me check again. The input is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...] so starting at index 4 (the fifth element) there are six 8s. So exactly six. The output replaces those six with six 4s. But in another example, like the first test case in Example 0, the first input list has three 8s (positions 5,6,7) which are left as 8s in the output. So the replacement only happens when there's a run of exactly six? Or at least six?\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's fourth input list: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...]. The output is [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,...]. Here, again, six 8s starting at index 4. Replaced by six 4s. So maybe the rule is: any consecutive sequence of six identical numbers is replaced by six 4s. But what if there are more than six? Let's check. For instance, in Example 0's eighth input list: the output doesn't have 4s. Let's see. The input is [3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]. The output is the same as the input here, so no 4s. That means there's no sequence of six same numbers here. So the replacement occurs only when there are exactly six in a row.\n\nWait, but let's check other examples. In Example 1, the third input list has a run of six 6s, replaced by six 4s. Then the fourth input list has a run of six 6s again, replaced by 4s. But in the test input, maybe the replacement is when there's a run of exactly six, and it's replaced by six 4s. So the key is to look for runs of six identical numbers and replace them with six 4s. Other elements remain the same.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 0, the 13th input list (input index 12) is [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]. The output here has [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,...] and then starting at index 22 (assuming 0-based), the next elements are 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six 3s. The output replaces them with 4s: [4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, no. Wait, the output is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. Oh, the six 3s starting at position 22 are replaced by five 4s? Wait no, the input has six 3s: positions 22 to 27 (if the list is 0-based). Let's count:\n\nOriginal input from index 22: 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six elements. The output replaces them with 4,4,4,4,4. Wait, that's five 4s. Wait, but that's conflicting. Oh, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nLooking at positions 22-27 (since the list is 0-based), elements 22 is the 23rd element. Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let's list them properly:\n\nIndices 0-29:\n\n0:8,1:6,2:2,3:8,4:2,5:2,6:2,7:3,8:3,9:8,\n\n10:1,11:1,12:3,13:1,14:6,15:1,16:3,17:2,18:8,19:3,\n\n20:8,21:3,22:3,23:3,24:3,25:3,26:3,27:1,28:8,29:1.\n\nSo from index 21 to 26: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (indices 21-26). Wait that's six 3s. The output for this input is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nWait, the output elements 22-26 are 4,4,4,4,4 (five elements) but the original had six 3s. So this would replace six elements with five 4s. That doesn't fit the previous pattern. Hmm. So maybe there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six elements, but in this case, the run is six, so replaced by six 4s. But in the output, the 4s are from index 22 to 26 (five elements). Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check again. The original input elements from 21 to 26 are index 21:3, 22:3, 23:3, 24:3, 25:3, 26:3. So six elements. The output for these positions is 4,4,4,4,4 (positions 22 to 26). Wait, that's five 4s. So replacing six elements with five 4s? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me look back at the example:\n\nIn Example 0, the 13th input (input index 12) is:\n\nINPUT:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nWait, the output starts at index 22 (element 23) with 4, then four more 4s, making five total. But the input had six 3s. So that's a problem. Maybe the replacement is when there are exactly six, but the output is four 4s. Wait, maybe the rule isn't just replacing six same numbers with six 4s. Maybe it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for sequences of six or more, but only the first six are replaced by five 4s. That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for sequences of exactly six elements, replaced by five 4s. But why five?\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is for a run of six, which is replaced by five 4s. But why? That doesn't align with the earlier examples. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the third input is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, ...]. The output is [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,...]. Here, six 8s are replaced by six 4s. So in that case, the count matches. So why in the other case, it's five? Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the input list for the 13th example (input index 12), the part in question is:\n\nIndices 20-27:\n\n20:8, 21:3, 22:3, 23:3, 24:3, 25:3, 26:3, 27:1.\n\nSo elements 21 to 26 are six 3s. The output is:\n\n20:8, 21:3, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:1.\n\nWait, that's replacing the six 3s (indices 21-26) with five 4s (indices 22-26). Wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, perhaps the output is:\n\nOriginal indices 21-26 (6 elements) are replaced by 4,4,4,4,4 (5 elements). That would change the length of the list, but in the examples, the input and output lists are the same length. So that can't be. Therefore, I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, the input list has 30 elements, and the output list also has 30 elements. So in the 13th input example, the output has the same length. Let me recount. The input in positions 21-26 is 3,3,3,3,3,3. The output in those positions is 3 (at 21), then 4,4,4,4,4 (positions 22-26), and position 27 is 1. So the original six elements (indices 21-26) in the input become in the output: 3 (index 21), then four 4s (indices 22-25?), but that's not matching. Wait, no. Let's look at the output again for this input:\n\nOutput is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nSo the elements starting from index 22 (position 23) are 4,4,4,4,4. Wait, that's five 4s. But the original six 3s started at index 21. So the output at index 21 is 3, then indices 22-26 are five 4s. But the original had six elements (indices 21-26). So the output replaces the six elements (3,3,3,3,3,3) with 3 followed by five 4s. That would make the list length the same. Wait, that's impossible. So perhaps my counting is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let's list the input and output for that specific part:\n\nInput indices 20-27 (elements 20 to 27):\n\n20:8, 21:3, 22:3, 23:3, 24:3, 25:3, 26:3, 27:1.\n\nOutput:\n\n20:8, 21:3, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:1.\n\nSo the input's indices 21-26 (six 3s) become output indices 21-26: 3,4,4,4,4,4. So the first 3 at index 21 remains, and the next five 3s are replaced by four 4s? That can't be, because that would only replace five elements. Wait, but the output has at index 21 the same 3 as input, then indices 22-26 (five positions) are 4s. So the original six elements (indices 21-26) are replaced by the 3 at 21 and five 4s from 22-26. That's six elements replaced by six elements (3 followed by five 4s). So the total length remains the same. So why is that?\n\nThat suggests that the rule isn't simply replacing a run of six same numbers with six 4s. Because in this case, the run is six 3s, but only five are replaced. So maybe the rule is different. Maybe the run must be exactly six, but the replacement starts after the first element? Or maybe the rule is that if there's a run of six same numbers, starting from the first occurrence, replace the next five with 4s. Wait, in this example, the run is six 3s. The output keeps the first 3 and replaces the next five with 4s. So the first element remains, the next five become 4s. So total of six elements: one 3 and five 4s. That way, the run of six becomes 3 followed by five 4s. So the rule would be: for any run of six identical numbers, keep the first one and replace the next five with 4s. Then for runs longer than six, perhaps this applies to the first six, and the remaining are left as is?\n\nWait, let's check another example. In Example 0's fifth input list:\n\nINPUT: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\n\nOUTPUT: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nLooking at the input's fifth element (index 4) onward: eight 8s. The output here has six 4s starting at index 4. Wait, the input has eight 8s (indices 4-11?), but the output replaces the first six with six 4s, and leaves the remaining two 8s? Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal input indices 4-11: 8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3 (wait, no, maybe the run is longer). Wait the input list is:\n\n[3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nSo indices 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). Then index 10 is 3. So the output for indices 4-9: replaced by six 4s. Then the next part of the input has 2s starting at index 20: indices 20-27: eight 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. Wait, in the output, the indices 20-26: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (seven 4s). So the input's eight 2s are replaced by seven 4s. That's different. So how does this fit the previous pattern?\n\nWait, the input here has eight 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So the rule can't be just replacing a run of six. Because in the previous case, six 8s became six 4s, but eight 2s become seven 4s. So maybe the rule is different. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of six or more, and the entire run is replaced by 4s of the same length. But then in the first case, six 8s become six 4s. In the second case, eight 2s become seven 4s. That doesn't align. So this suggests that there's another pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six, and if longer than six, only the first six are replaced. But in the example with eight 2s, the output has seven 4s. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace all consecutive duplicates beyond a certain point. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six same numbers, and replace them with six 4s, but if the run is longer than six, then replace the entire run with 4s. Wait, but in the case of eight 2s, the output has seven 4s, which is the same as the length. So eight 2s become seven 4s. Wait, that can't be, because that would require the length to change, but the input and output lists are the same length.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's approach this methodically. Let's take Example 0's third input and output:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nIn the input, the run starting at index 4 (element 5) is six 8s. These are replaced by six 4s. Then later, starting at index 20 (element 21), there are seven 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So here, even though the run is longer than six, the entire run is replaced. So perhaps the rule is: replace any consecutive run of a number that is six or longer with 4s of the same length. So runs of six or more same numbers are replaced by 4s for the entire length.\n\nBut in the earlier case where the input had six 3s (indices 21-26 in example 12), the output replaced them with five 4s. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me recheck that example.\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nOutput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nThe input has six 3s starting at index 21 (elements 21-26). The output has at those positions 3,4,4,4,4,4. So the first element (index 21) is 3, then five 4s. That's six elements. So the first 3 remains, then the next five 3s become 4s. So this is a different pattern. So why in this case, the first element is kept and the next five are replaced?\n\nThis suggests that the rule might be: for any run of six or more same numbers, replace the entire run with 4s, but starting from the second element of the run. For example, a run of six would have the first element unchanged, and the next five replaced with 4s. A run of seven would have the first element and six 4s. Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nIn the input where there are six 3s (indices 21-26), the output is 3 followed by five 4s. So that's a total of six elements. So the first element of the run is kept, and the rest are replaced with 4s. But wait, in the previous example with six 8s, all six were replaced with 4s. That's conflicting. So perhaps the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement depends on the position of the run. For example, if the run starts at a certain index. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is triggered only when the run is six or longer, and the entire run is replaced by 4s. But then why in some examples, like the one with six 8s, they are all replaced, but in the case of six 3s, only five are replaced?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 0's sixth input:\n\nINPUT: [8, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8]\n\nOUTPUT: [8, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 3, 8]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s starting at index 4, replaced by six 4s. Then later, seven 2s starting at index 20 (elements 20-26) are replaced by seven 4s. But the output shows that the first two 2s (indices 20 and 21) are replaced, but in the output, index 20 is 4, index 21-26 are 4s. So seven 2s become seven 4s. That aligns with the rule that runs of six or more are replaced entirely with 4s.\n\nBut then why in the earlier example with six 3s, the first 3 was kept and the rest replaced with 4s? That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me recheck the input and output of the 13th example.\n\nINPUT for the 13th example (index 12 in Example 0):\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nSo the run of six 3s is at indices 21-26 (elements 21 to 26). The output has 3 at index 21, then 4s from 22 to 26. So the run starts at index 21, but the output replaces only indices 22-26. That's five 4s. So the total is six elements (3 followed by five 4s). So the first element of the run remains, the next five are replaced. But why?\n\nThis suggests that the rule is: replace any run of six identical numbers by keeping the first occurrence and replacing the next five with 4s. This would explain the six 3s becoming one 3 and five 4s. Similarly, in the example with eight 2s (run of eight), the first element is kept, and the next seven are replaced with 4s. Wait, but in the earlier example with six 8s, all six were replaced with 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in the third example of Example 0, the input has six 8s replaced by six 4s. So no leading element kept. But in the 13th example, six 3s become one 3 and five 4s. So there's inconsistency here. Unless I'm misunderstanding the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is triggered only when the run is exactly six, and the entire run is replaced with 4s. But in the case of the six 8s, they are replaced. For runs longer than six, like seven 2s, the entire run is replaced with 4s. But then why in the 13th example, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s and a 3?\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me look at another example. Example 0's seventh input:\n\nINPUT: [1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6]\n\nOUTPUT: [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nHere, the input has seven 8s starting at index 4 (elements 4-10). The output replaces the first six with 4s, and leaves the seventh 8 as is. So the run of seven 8s becomes six 4s and one 8. But that changes the length of the list. But the input and output have the same length. So this can't be. So perhaps the entire seven 8s are replaced with seven 4s. Let me check the output: the output at indices 4-10 are 4,4,4,4,4,4,8. So six 4s and then an 8. But that would mean the original seven 8s are replaced with six 4s and one 8, which shortens the run. But the output list must have the same length. So this suggests that the replacement is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s starting from the second occurrence. For example, in a run of six, the first element is kept, and the next five are replaced. For a run of seven, the first is kept, next six replaced, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn the third example of Example 0, the six 8s are replaced by six 4s. But according to this rule, the first should be kept and the next five replaced. But the output shows all six replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that if the run is exactly six, replace all with 4s. If the run is longer than six, replace all with 4s. But the example with seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. But then why the six 3s are replaced by five 4s and a 3?\n\nThis is getting too inconsistent. Let's look for another pattern. Maybe the replacement occurs in certain positions. For example, in the training examples, the replacement occurs in specific parts of the list. For instance, in Example 0, the replacements are in the middle of the list where there are long runs of 8s, 2s, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is not based on the numbers themselves but their positions. For example, certain indices are replaced with 4s. But that's unlikely, since the inputs vary.\n\nAnother angle: look at the test input. For example, in the test input, one of the lists is:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, there's a long run of 8s starting at index 4 (assuming 0-based). Let's count: index 4 is 8, and then from index 6 to 15: eight 8s. Wait, maybe index 4 is 8, index 5 is 6, then indices 6-15 are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. So that's ten 8s. According to the possible rule, this run would be replaced with 4s. So the output would have ten 4s. But according to the training examples, if the run is longer than six, the entire run is replaced with 4s.\n\nBut in Example 0's seventh input, a run of seven 8s is replaced by six 4s and an 8. But that doesn't fit. So I'm stuck.\n\nAnother approach: compare the inputs and outputs and see what's changed. For each output, look for the positions where the number 4 appears. Then in the input, those positions must have been part of a run of the same number, and the run must be of a certain length.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output for the third input:\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nThe 4s are at positions 4-9 (six 4s) and 20-26 (seven 4s). The corresponding input has six 8s and seven 2s. So the output replaces those runs with 4s. So perhaps the rule is: replace any run of six or more of the same number with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo in the input, if there's a run of six or more same numbers, replace all elements in that run with 4s. That would explain the first case: six 8s become six 4s. Seven 2s become seven 4s. Then in the case of six 3s in the 13th example, why does the output have five 4s and a 3?\n\nWait, the input in the 13th example's six 3s (indices 21-26) would become six 4s. But the output shows 3 followed by five 4s. That contradicts the rule. So perhaps there's an exception to the rule. Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the run starts at a different index. Let's recheck the input and output of the 13th example:\n\nInput (indices 20-27):\n\n20:8, 21:3, 22:3, 23:3, 24:3, 25:3, 26:3, 27:1.\n\nOutput (indices 20-27):\n\n20:8, 21:3, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:1.\n\nSo the run of 3s starts at index 21 and ends at 26 (six elements). According to the rule, they should be six 4s. But the output has a 3 at index 21 and five 4s. So this contradicts the rule. Therefore, the rule must be different.\n\nWait, perhaps the run is considered to start after a certain condition. Like, the run must start at an even index or something. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs that are exactly six, and longer runs are left as is. But in other examples, longer runs are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied only to runs of even numbers. But in the examples, 8s and 2s are even and replaced, but 3s (odd) are sometimes replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the replacement is applied to the first occurrence of a run of six or more, and subsequent runs are not. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied only to runs of 8s and 2s. Let's check. In Example 0's third input, 8s and 2s are replaced. In the 13th example, 3s are replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but the first element of the run is kept if the number is odd, and replaced if even. For example, even numbers have their entire run replaced, while odd numbers have the first element kept. But let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's third input, the run of six 8s (even) are all replaced. In the 13th example, the run of six 3s (odd) are replaced with one 3 and five 4s. In another example, a run of seven 2s (even) are all replaced with 4s. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the rule could be: for any run of six or more consecutive numbers, if the number is even, replace all elements with 4s. If the number is odd, keep the first element and replace the rest with 4s.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nExample 0's third input:\n\nSix 8s (even) \u2192 replaced with six 4s. Correct.\n\nSeven 2s (even) \u2192 replaced with seven 4s. Correct.\n\nExample 0's 13th input:\n\nSix 3s (odd) \u2192 first 3 kept, next five replaced. Correct.\n\nExample 0's seventh input:\n\nSeven 8s (even) \u2192 replaced with seven 4s? But the output shows six 4s and an 8. Wait, no. Let's look again.\n\nInput seventh example:\n\n[1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nThe run of 8s is seven elements long (indices 4-10: eight, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight). But the output replaces indices 4-9 with 4s (six 4s), and index 10 is 8. So the first six 8s are replaced, the seventh remains. This contradicts the hypothesis. Because 8 is even, the entire run should be replaced. But here, only six are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that for even numbers, runs of six or more are replaced with 4s for the first six elements, and the rest are left as is. For odd numbers, only the first element is kept, and the next five are replaced, regardless of the run length.\n\nBut this seems complicated and inconsistent. Let's check another example.\n\nExample 0's fifth input:\n\nInput: [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nOutput: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nHere, the run of 8s (even) is six elements, replaced by six 4s. The run of 2s (even) is eight elements, replaced by seven 4s. But why seven? The run is eight elements. So according to the previous idea, the first six are replaced, leaving two. But the output has seven 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire run is replaced, regardless of length, if it's even. The run of 8s (six elements) becomes six 4s. The run of 2s (eight elements) becomes eight 4s. But the output shows seven 4s. So that's not possible. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Let's try to find another approach. Maybe the pattern is not about the numbers but their positions. For example, every sixth element is replaced. But the examples don't support that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves looking for sequences where the same number appears six times consecutively, and replacing those sequences with six 4s. All other elements remain the same. So even if the run is longer than six, only the first six are replaced. For example, a run of eight 8s would have the first six replaced with 4s and the remaining two left as 8s. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input, there's a run of eight 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire run is replaced with 4s if the length is exactly six. Longer or shorter runs are left as is. But in Example 0's third input, the run of six 8s is replaced, but the run of seven 2s is also replaced. So that's not it.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's fifth input, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s. That would imply that the replacement is for runs of seven or more. But in Example 0's third input, a run of six 8s is replaced, which would contradict that.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let's try to find a commonality between all the replacements:\n\nLooking at Example 0's outputs:\n\n- In the third input, six 8s become six 4s. Seven 2s become seven 4s.\n\n- In the fourth input, six 8s become six 4s.\n\n- In the fifth input, six 8s become six 4s. Eight 2s become seven 4s. (But why seven?)\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in counting the output for the fifth input. Let's check again.\n\nInput fifth example:\n\n[3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nOutput:\n\n[3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nSo the run of eight 2s starts at index 20. The output has seven 4s starting at index 20. So the run of eight 2s is replaced by seven 4s. That's conflicting with the idea that the entire run is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done only for the first six elements of any run of six or more. So, for example, a run of eight 2s would have the first six replaced with 4s, and the remaining two left as 2s. But in the output, the seven 4s suggest that the first seven are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let's try to look for another pattern. Maybe the 4s are inserted in the output where there are consecutive numbers of length six in the input. For example, if there's a run of six, replace with 4s. If there's a longer run, replace the entire run with 4s. So:\n\nRule: In the input list, replace every consecutive run of six or more identical numbers with 4s, with the length of the run preserved.\n\nIn Example 0's third input:\n\n- Six 8s \u2192 six 4s.\n\n- Seven 2s \u2192 seven 4s.\n\nIn Example 0's 13th input:\n\n- Six 3s \u2192 six 4s. But in the output, the first 3 is kept. So this rule doesn't apply here.\n\nSo this is conflicting. Unless there's an error in the example. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different rule involving the sum of the numbers or their positions. But I can't see any such pattern.\n\nLet me look at the test input to see if I can find a pattern there. For example, one of the test input lists is:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more same numbers. The third element is 3,3,3 (three 3s). No. Then later, there are three 1s. No. So perhaps no runs of six here. So the output would be the same as input.\n\nAnother test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, there's a run of six 1s from index 21 to 26. So this should be replaced with six 4s. So the output for this list would have 4s there.\n\nAnother test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, the run of seven 1s from index 20 to 26. So replaced by seven 4s.\n\nAnother test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, there's a long run of 8s from index 6 to 15 (ten 8s). So replaced by ten 4s.\n\nBut according to the examples, if the run is even, they are replaced. But according to Example 0's seventh input, a run of seven 8s is replaced with six 4s and one 8, which conflicts. So I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the conflicting observations, I'll proceed with the rule that any consecutive run of six or more same numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length. This seems to fit most of the examples, except the one with six 3s. But perhaps that's an exception or a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that runs of exactly six are replaced with 4s, and longer runs are left as is. But that doesn't fit the example with seven 2s being replaced.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the rule that runs of six or more same numbers are replaced with 4s of the same length. For the test input, I'll apply this rule and see if it fits.\n\nSo for each list in the test input, I'll look for runs of six or more same numbers and replace them with 4s."
