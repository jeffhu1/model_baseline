        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me start by carefully looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output arrays. Let's compare them. The first two input rows are the same as the output. But starting from the third row, there are some changes. Let's take the third input row in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nNoticing that a sequence of consecutive 8s in the input (positions 4-9) becomes 4s in the output. Similarly, the consecutive 2s (positions 20-26) also become 4s. The same pattern happens in other rows. For instance, in the next row:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the 8s (positions 4-9) and 2s (20-26) are replaced with 4s. So, the pattern here seems to be replacing sequences of six or more identical numbers with 4s. Wait, but in the first example, there are six 8s and seven 2s. Let me check how many elements are replaced each time.\n\nWait, in the third input row, positions 4-9: that's 6 elements (indices 4 to 9 inclusive) of 8s. The output replaces them with 4s. Similarly, the 2s from position 20 to 26: that's 7 elements, which are replaced with 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers gets replaced with the number 4. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nTake the third row in Example 1's input:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the 6s starting at position 5: there are 9 consecutive 6s. They are replaced with 4s. So, the rule seems to be that any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s. But wait, in the output of Example 0's third row, the 2s starting at position 20 are seven in a row, replaced by 4s. So the replacement is for sequences of 6 or longer.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the input might have multiple such sequences. Let me check another example.\n\nTake Example 0's fourth input row:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\nOutput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\n\nHere, the 8s from positions 4-9 (6 elements) become 4s, and the 2s from positions 20-26 (7 elements) become 4s. So two separate sequences are replaced.\n\nAnother example in Example 0: the 13th input row:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nHere, the sequence of six 3s (positions 22-27) is replaced with 4s. So that's another case where a run of exactly six elements is replaced.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in each row of the input, any consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers is replaced with the number 4 repeated the same number of times. The rest of the numbers remain the same.\n\nBut let's check if there's a case where the run is exactly six. For example, in Example 0, the third row's first replacement is six 8s, which becomes six 4s. Then in another row, maybe a run of seven would become seven 4s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 0's first input row, there's a run of three 8s (positions 6-8) which remains as 8s. So only runs of six or more are replaced.\n\nSo the transformation rule is: For each row, replace every consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers with the same number of 4s. All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's verify this with the other examples. For example, in Example 1, the third input row:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the sequence of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. Correct.\n\nAnother example in Example 1's input, the 17th row:\n\nInput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\nOutput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nWait, but in the output provided, the 17th row of Example 1's output is:\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck. Looking back at Example 1's input, the 17th input row (assuming the list starts at 0):\n\nLooking at the INPUT section for Example 1, the 17th input is:\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nAh, right. The sequence of seven 8s starting at position 13 (indices 13 to 19, inclusive) is replaced with seven 4s. So that fits the pattern: runs of six or more same numbers are replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother example in the test input: let's look at the third test input row (third in the list):\n\nTest input third row:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for sequences of six or more. The part at positions 21-26: [1,1,1,1,1,1], which is six 1s. So this should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for that row would have 4s in those positions.\n\nAnother test input row: fourth row:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking here, the sequence starting at position 6: eight 8s (positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8, which is 10 elements). Wait, positions 6 to 15 inclusive? Let's count:\n\nOriginal array is:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nSo from index 6 (value 8) to index 15 (value 8). That's 10 elements of 8. So this should be replaced with ten 4s. Then, in positions 20-26: seven 1s. So those would be replaced with 4s. So the output for this row would have 4s in those ranges.\n\nSo applying this to all test input rows: for each row, replace any consecutive sequence of 6+ same numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each test input row.\n\nLet's process each test input row one by one.\n\nTest Input Row 0: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check consecutive numbers:\n\n- 3,3,3 (positions 2-4): only 3 elements. Not enough.\n- 8,8 (positions 9-10): 2 elements.\n- 1,1,1 (positions 17-19): 3 elements.\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 in another row? Wait, looking at other rows. This row has 3 ones in positions 17-19, but nothing longer. So no sequences to replace. So output is same as input.\n\nTest Input Row 1: [1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n- 6,6: 2 elements.\n- 8,8 (positions 3-4): 2.\n- 8,8 (positions 10-11): 2.\n- 8,8 (positions 17-18): 2.\n- 8,8,8 (positions 26-28): 3. So no runs of 6. So output same as input.\n\nTest Input Row 2: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 21-26: six 1s. So replace these six 1s with six 4s. The rest remains. So the output for this row would be:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nTest Input Row 3: [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck runs. In this row, the sequence from position 21-27 (indices 20-26) is seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s. So output for this row:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3]\n\nWait, but indices start from 0. The 1s start at position 20 (value 1), then 21-26: seven elements. So positions 20 to 26 inclusive. So seven 1s. Replace with 4s. So the output for this row would have 4s from index 20 to 26.\n\nTest Input Row 4: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence starting at position 6 (value 8) and continues to position 15: positions 6-15. Let's count:\n\nIndices 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements). So a run of ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Then, positions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s. So output for this row:\n\nOriginal starts as [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nAfter replacement:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nWait, positions 6-15 (inclusive) is 10 elements. So indices 6 to 15 are replaced. Then positions 20-26 (7 elements) replaced.\n\nSo the row becomes:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nTest Input Row 5: [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nCheck for runs. The sequence from position 6 to 15: indices 6-15 are 8s. 10 elements. Replace with 4s. Then, positions 21-25: five 1s (only five), which is less than six. Then position 26 is a 6. So the replacement is only the 8s. So output:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nTest Input Row 6: [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The first four 3s: positions 0-3 (4 elements). Not enough. Then, the 8s at positions 4: one 8. Then, 8s from position 6 to 15: 10 elements. Replace those. Then, 8s from position 22-27: six 8s. Replace those as well.\n\nSo:\n\nOriginal row:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nReplacing runs:\n\n- 8s from index 6-15: 10 elements \u2192 4s.\n- 8s from index 22-27: six elements \u2192 4s.\n\nSo output:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,1,1,6,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3]\n\nTest Input Row 7: [3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nCheck runs.

So replace them with six 4s. Also, the initial 8,8,8 (indices 0-2) is three elements. So in this row, the 3s from 15-20 (six elements) become 4s. So output:\n\n[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nTest Input Row 20: [6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCheck for runs.

The 3s from indices 16-22: seven elements. Replace with 4s. Also, the 3s at the end: indices 25-29: four 3s. So output:\n\n[1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nTest Input Row 24: [1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\n\nCheck runs.
