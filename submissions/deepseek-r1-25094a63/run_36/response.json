        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this pattern. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output arrays. The outputs have some numbers replaced with 4s. Let me check where those 4s are coming from.\n\nFirst, in Example 0, the input arrays have sequences of 8s. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0, the input is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, ...] and the output replaces the six 8s starting at position 4 with six 4s. Similarly, other sequences of 6s or other numbers don't get replaced. So maybe it's about consecutive 8s?\n\nWait, but looking at another part in the same example: the second input array in Example 0 has [3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, ...], and the output keeps those 8s as 8s. Hmm. So why are those not replaced? Maybe the length matters. Let's see: in the third input array of Example 0, there are six 8s in a row. The output replaces them with 4s. Other examples: in the fourth input array of Example 0, there's a sequence of eight 8s, which in the output becomes six 4s? Wait, no. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait the third input array in Example 0's input is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, ...], so positions 4-9 are six 8s. The output replaces them with 4s. Similarly, the next array in Example 0 has [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...], which becomes 4s. So maybe whenever there are six or more consecutive 8s, they are replaced with 4s for the length of the run?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, let's look. In the third input array of Example 1's input, the numbers are [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, ...]. The output replaces the consecutive 6s (nine of them) with 4s. So it's not just 8s. Wait, but in the output, those 6s become 4s. So maybe any consecutive numbers of 6 or more of the same digit are replaced by 4s for that entire run?\n\nWait in Example 0's third input array, the 8s are replaced. In Example 1's third input array, the 6s are replaced. So the key is that any sequence of 6 or more of the same number, regardless of which number, gets replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nLooking at the outputs, yes. So the pattern is: in each array, wherever there is a consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number, replace each element of that sequence with 4. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nLet's verify with more examples. Take Example 0's third input array: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...]. The 8s from index 4 to 9 (six 8s) are replaced with six 4s. Another example in Example 0's input: the fifth array starts with [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8, ...], so six 8s replaced by six 4s.\n\nIn Example 1, the third input array's 6s are replaced with 4s. So the rule seems consistent. So the transformation is: for each run of six or more identical numbers, replace each element in that run with 4.\n\nNow, apply this to the test input. Let's take the test input arrays and check for runs of six or more same numbers.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst array: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. Scanning for consecutive runs. 3,3,3 (three 3s) \u2014 not enough. Then 8,8 (two). 1,1,1 (three 1s). So no runs of 6 here. So this array remains the same.\n\nSecond array: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. Check consecutive. The 8,8,8 at the end (three) \u2014 not enough. So no changes.\n\nThird array: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, from index 20 to 25 (assuming 0-based) there are six 1s. So replace those six 1s with six 4s. So the output here would have [..., 2, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 8,3,6].\n\nFourth array: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. The sequence from index 21 to 26 (seven 1s) \u2014 that's seven, so replace with 4s. So the output here would have [..., 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 2,6,3].\n\nFifth array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. Here, starting at index 6 (assuming 0-based), the 8s are from index 6 to 15 (10 8s). That's a run of 10, so replace all with 4s. The output would have [8,1,2,3,8,6, followed by ten 4s, then the rest as is].\n\nSixth array: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then the 1s from index 20 to 24 (five 1s) \u2192 not enough. So only the 8s are replaced.\n\nSeventh array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. The first four 3s (index 0-3) are four \u2192 no. Then 8,3 \u2192 no. Then from index 6 to 15 (10 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then the 8s at 22-27 (six 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s. So output has those runs as 4s.\n\nEighth array: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8s from index 6 to 16 (11 8s) \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then three 8s at the end \u2192 not enough. So that part becomes 4s.\n\nNinth array: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 8s) \u2192 4s. Then three 8s later \u2192 no.\n\nTenth array: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 8s) \u2192 4s. The last three 8s \u2192 no.\n\nEleventh array: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]. The 8s from index 5 to 14 (10 8s) \u2192 4s. Then three 8s later \u2192 no. The three 1s at the end \u2192 no.\n\nTwelfth array: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]. Check consecutive runs. The three 2s at the end \u2192 no. So no replacement.\n\nThirteenth array: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]. The 2s at index 10-13 (four 2s) \u2192 no. The three 3s \u2192 no.\n\nFourteenth array: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]. The 3,3 at index 10-11 \u2192 no. The 6,6 \u2192 no. The 3,3 \u2192 no. So no replacement.\n\nFifteenth array: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]. The three 8s at the end \u2192 no. So no runs of six.\n\nSixteenth array: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]. Three 3s \u2192 no.\n\nSeventeenth array: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]. The three 8s \u2192 no.\n\nEighteenth array: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]. No runs of six.\n\nNineteenth array: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]. No runs.\n\nTwentieth array: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. The six 3s from index 13-18 (if starting at 3,3,3,3,6 \u2192 wait, maybe I need to check. Wait the array is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Let's look: starting at index 10: 3,3,3,3,6 (indexes 10-14: four 3s, then a 6. Then after 6, indexes 15-20 are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). So that's a run of six 3s. So those six 3s are replaced with six 4s.\n\nSimilarly, the next array in test input: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. The 3s from index 15-20 (six 3s) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother test array: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]. The 3s from index 15-20 (six 3s) \u2192 but wait, starting at 15: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s). So that's a run of seven, replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother array: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]. The 3s from index 16-21 (six 3s) \u2192 replaced.\n\nAnother array: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]. The 3s from index 16-22 (seven 3s) \u2192 replaced.\n\nSo the key is to scan each array for consecutive runs of the same number that are six or longer and replace those with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input arrays. For each array in the test input, check each position to see if there's a run of 6+ same numbers. Replace those runs with 4s. All other numbers stay the same.\n\nThe final outputs would then have 4s in those positions where there were runs of six or more same numbers, others as original."
