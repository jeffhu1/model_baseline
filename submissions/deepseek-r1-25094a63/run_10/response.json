        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let me start by looking at the first example. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output, I notice that some sequences of numbers in the input are replaced with 4s in the output. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the sequence of eight 8s starting at position 4 is replaced with six 4s. Similarly, the seven 2s starting at position 20 are replaced with seven 4s. Wait, but the count of 4s seems to match the original count. Wait, original sequence is 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) in the input. They become six 4s. Then the 2s are seven in a row, replaced by seven 4s. So maybe whenever there's a consecutive run of the same number longer than or equal to a certain length, it's replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nBut in Example 0's second array:\n\nInput: [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]\nOutput: [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]\n\nHere, there are two 8s in positions 11 and 12 (original input), and they remain as 8,8 in the output. So maybe the replacement only happens when the run is longer than a certain length, like 5 or 6. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nThird input array is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nOutput replaces the sequence of nine 6s starting at position 5 with nine 4s. So the input had a run of nine 6s, which became nine 4s. So perhaps any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, in the first example's third input array, the six 8s become six 4s. The seven 2s become seven 4s. So the threshold might be runs of 6 or more. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's fourth input array:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nOriginal run at positions 4-9: six 8s \u2192 six 4s. Then the seven 2s at positions 20-26 become seven 4s, and the eighth 2 at position 27 becomes a 2. Wait, the original input has eight 2s (positions 20-27?), but in the output, it's seven 4s followed by a 2. Wait, the input array in example 0's fourth input is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nSo from index 20 (0-based) which is the 21st element, the 2s start. Let's count: positions 20 to 27 (inclusive) are eight 2s. But the output is [...,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,...]. So seven 4s and then a 2. That's odd. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's recheck:\n\nOriginal input array from example 0's fourth array:\n\nAfter position 20 (assuming the list is 0-based), elements 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 8 elements. So why are seven replaced with 4s and the eighth remains 2? That contradicts the initial idea. Hmm, maybe the pattern isn't just replacing runs of 6 or more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly 6. Wait, but in the first example, the six 8s were replaced. Then the seven 2s were replaced with seven 4s. But in this fourth input array, the 8s (six in a row) are replaced with six 4s, and the eight 2s are replaced with seven 4s and then a 2. That doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, the input array's 2s: positions 20-27 (indices 20 to 27 inclusive) are 8 elements. The output replaces them with 4s starting at position 20. Let me check the output array for that input:\n\nOutput: [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo from index 20 (output array's index 20), the elements are 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. That's seven 4s followed by a 2. But the original input had eight 2s. So why seven replaced? Wait, maybe the run is split. Like, maybe the first seven are part of the run, then the eighth is separate? But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4s, but only up to a certain point. Or perhaps there's a different rule.\n\nLooking at another example. Let's take the fifth input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\nOutput: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9) \u2192 six 4s. Then the 2s starting at index 20: there are eight 2s (indices 20-27). The output replaces them with seven 4s followed by a 3. Wait, the output shows seven 4s and then the original 3. So that's 7 elements replaced. Wait, original 8 elements. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that consecutive sequences of exactly six of the same number are replaced with six 4s, and sequences longer than six are replaced with the same number of 4s. But in the case where there are eight 2s, like in the fourth example, why seven 4s? That doesn't fit. Unless there's a mistake in the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to replace the first six elements of any run of six or more with 4s. So if there's a run of seven, replace six with 4s, leaving the seventh as is. Wait, but in the first example's third input, the 8s are six, all replaced. The 2s are seven, all replaced. So that doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe any run of six or more is replaced entirely by 4s. So runs of six, seven, eight, etc., are all replaced by the same number of 4s. Let me check.\n\nIn the third input of Example 0, the seven 2s are replaced by seven 4s. The fourth input's eight 2s are replaced by seven 4s and a 2. Wait, that's inconsistent. Maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal fourth input array in Example 0:\n\nInput array after index 20 (positions 20-27):\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 eight 2s. Output array at those positions: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and then a 2. That's eight elements. So perhaps the first seven are replaced, leaving one. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six. But in the first case, six 8s are replaced. The seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. That suggests that runs of six or more are replaced. So why in the fourth example, eight 2s become seven 4s and a 2? That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement starts at the sixth element. For example, when there's a run of n elements (n \u22656), the sixth and onward elements are replaced with 4s, but the first five remain. Wait, let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third input array, the run of six 8s: all replaced by 4s. So that doesn't fit. If the first five are left as 8s and the sixth and beyond as 4s, but in the output they are all 4s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if there are exactly six consecutive same numbers, replace them with 4s. If more than six, replace the first six with 4s and leave the rest as original. But in the third example, a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. That contradicts this idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more. All elements in the run are replaced with 4s, regardless of length. So in the fourth input array, the eight 2s should become eight 4s. But the output is seven 4s and a 2. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement applies to runs of six or more, but only if the run is followed by a different number. Wait, perhaps not. Let's look at the fourth input again. The run of eight 2s ends with the 2s, followed by 1 and 3. So the entire run of eight should be replaced with eight 4s. But the output shows seven 4s and a 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the indices again. Let's take the fourth input array from example 0:\n\nInput:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nIndices 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) \u2192 replaced by six 4s. Then indices 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (eight 2s). Output for these indices is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. That's eight elements. So why not eight 4s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different condition. Like, the run must be exactly six, or exactly seven, but that doesn't fit other examples. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but not overlapping. Maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, looking at another example. Let's take example 1's third input array:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nThe input has a run of nine 6s starting at position 5. The output replaces all nine with 4s. So that supports the idea that any run of six or more is replaced with the same number of 4s. But then why in the previous example, the eight 2s were replaced with seven 4s and a 2?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in that example. Let me recheck example 0's fourth input array. The input has eight 2s in positions 20-27. The output for those positions is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, that's eight elements. So seven 4s and one 2. But why? The original eight 2s should become eight 4s. So this is a problem. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the sixth element. So in a run of n \u22656, the sixth and subsequent elements are replaced with 4s. For example, in a run of six elements, all six are replaced. For a run of seven, the first five stay the same, the sixth and seventh become 4s. Wait, no. Let me test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example's third input array:\n\nThe six 8s are replaced with six 4s. If the rule is that starting from the sixth element, replace with 4s, then in a run of six, all six would be replaced. For a run of seven, the first five are original, sixth and seventh become 4s. But in the third input array of example 0, the seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s, which doesn't fit that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six. But the third example in example 0 has a run of seven 2s replaced with seven 4s, so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of 6 or more, but only the first six are replaced. But then in the third example, the seven 2s would become six 4s followed by a 2. But in the output, they are all 4s.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's eighth input array:\n\nInput: [3,1,3,8,3,2,3,8,1,3,1,8,1,3,1,2,3,1,8,6,2,1,3,1,1,8,3,1,6,3]\nOutput: same as input. So in this case, there are no runs of six or more. So this array remains unchanged. This supports the idea that only arrays with runs of six or more get replacements.\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's thirteenth input array:\n\nInput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\nOutput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nThe run of six 3s (positions 22-27) is replaced with four 4s and then a 3. Wait, wait: the output shows from index 22: 4,4,4,4,4,3. Original input has six 3s. Output has five 4s and a 3. That doesn't fit. So this is another problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for the first six elements in a run of six or more, and the rest remain. For example, if the run is longer than six, the first six are replaced with 4s, and the rest stay as original. Let's test this.\n\nIn the thirteenth input array:\n\nInput six 3s (positions 22-27): but the output is 4,4,4,4,4,3. So the first five are replaced with 4s, and the sixth stays as 3. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six. If there are exactly six, replace with 4s. If longer than six, replace the first six and leave the rest. But in the third example, seven 2s were replaced with seven 4s. So that contradicts that.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for another approach. Maybe the 4s are replacing sequences where the same number appears six times in a row. But perhaps it's more about the position of the run. Maybe the sixth element in the array is replaced, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, looking at the test input. The test input has multiple arrays. For example, the third test input array:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nIn the output, the seven 1s (positions 21-26) would become seven 4s. So perhaps in the test input, we need to identify runs of six or more and replace them with 4s.\n\nLet me try to apply this pattern to the test input.\n\nFor example, the third test input array:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more. The sequence from index 21 to 26 (0-based) is six 1s. So these six 1s should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nAnother test input array: the fourth one:\n\nInput: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The part from index 20 to 26: seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nAnother test input array, the fifth one:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nThe run of eight 8s starting at index 6 (positions 6-13) \u2192 eight 4s.\n\nSo applying this pattern: in each array, any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced with the same number of 4s.\n\nThus, for the test input arrays, we need to check each array for consecutive runs of six or more identical numbers and replace each such run with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's confirm this with the training examples. In Example 0's third input, the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. The seven 2s \u2192 seven 4s. In Example 1's third input, nine 6s become nine 4s. This supports the pattern.\n\nBut then, in Example 0's fourth input array, the eight 2s are replaced with seven 4s and a 2. That seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's recheck the fourth input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nThe run of 2s starts at index 20 (value 2), and the next elements are 2s up to index 27. That's 8 elements (indexes 20-27). The output from 20 to 27 is four 4s, four 4s, then a 2. Wait, no. Let's list the output array's elements from 20 to 27:\n\nIndices 20:4, 21:4, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:2.\n\nSo seven 4s and one 2. So that's eight elements, but the original eight 2s are replaced with seven 4s and one 2. That breaks the pattern. Why?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the example. Or perhaps there's another condition. Maybe the run is split into two parts. For example, if there's a run of eight 2s, but the first seven are replaced and the eighth is left. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement happens only once per array. No, because other examples have multiple replacements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done only for the first occurrence of a run of six or more. But in Example 0's third input, there are two runs replaced.\n\nThis is perplexing. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the replacement is to replace the sixth element and onward with 4s. For example, in a run of six, the sixth becomes 4, and the first five remain. Wait, in Example 0's third input, the six 8s are all replaced with 4s, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but the 4s start from the position where the sixth element is. For example, in a run of six, all six are replaced. In a run of seven, the sixth and seventh are replaced. But that would result in two 4s. But in the third example, seven 2s become seven 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the entire run is replaced with 4s if it's exactly six, and if longer, the first six are replaced and the rest remain. But in the third example, seven 2s become seven 4s, which contradicts that.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look at the test input and see what the expected output would be if the rule is to replace runs of six or more with 4s. For example, the third test input array has a run of six 1s. That would become six 4s. The fourth array has seven 1s, which become seven 4s. The fifth array has a run of eight 8s \u2192 eight 4s. The sixth array has a run of eight 8s \u2192 eight 4s. The seventh array has a run of thirteen 8s \u2192 thirteen 4s. The eighth array has a run of nine 8s \u2192 nine 4s. The ninth array has a run of eight 8s \u2192 eight 4s. The tenth array has a run of eleven 8s \u2192 eleven 4s. And so on.\n\nSo applying this pattern, I'll need to go through each array in the test input and replace any runs of six or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input provided.\n\nFor example, the first test input array:\n\n[6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more. The elements are: 6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6.\n\nNo runs of six or more here. The longest runs are three 3s (indices 2-4), three 8s (indices 8-10), three 1s (indices 17-19). So no replacements. The output array would be the same as the input.\n\nThe second test input array:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nThe run of two 6s, then two 8s, two 1s, etc. No runs of six or more. So output same.\n\nThird test input array:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nHere, indices 21-26 (assuming 0-based) are six 1s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nFourth array:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nRun of seven 1s at indices 20-26 (seven elements). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nThe run of ten 8s (indices 6-15) \u2192 ten 4s. Also, a run of seven 1s (indices 19-25) \u2192 seven 4s.\n\nWait, indices 6-15: elements 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). These become ten 4s. Then the run of seven 1s (indices 19-25) become seven 4s. The final element in the array is 8.\n\nSo the output for this array would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nSimilarly, other arrays are processed the same way.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: replace any consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers with the same number of 4s. All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this to all test input arrays."
