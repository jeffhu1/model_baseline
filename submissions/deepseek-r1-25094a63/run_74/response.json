        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists provided in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's start by looking at the examples closely.\n\nLooking at Example 0 and Example 1, I notice that in some of the input lists, certain sequences of numbers are replaced with 4s in the output. For instance, in Example 0's third input line:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, there's a run of six 8s starting at position 4, which in the output becomes six 4s. Similarly, the sequence of seven 2s starting at position 20 becomes seven 4s. But wait, in the output, the 8s are replaced with 4s, and the 2s are also replaced with 4s. So the pattern here isn't about replacing a specific number, but maybe replacing runs of a certain length with 4s.\n\nLooking at another example in Example 0: The second input list's output has a run of six 8s turned into 4s, and another run of seven 2s also into 4s. So the key seems to be replacing consecutive sequences of the same number that are of length 6 or more with 4s. Let's check if that holds for other examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third input line:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. So that fits. So the rule seems to be: any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length. Let's verify this with another example.\n\nIn Example 0's first input list, there's a run of three 3s, which isn't replaced. So the threshold is indeed 6 or more. Let's check another case in Example 1's input:\n\nTake the input line in Example 1 that starts with [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nThe output shows that the seven 8s starting at position 13 are replaced with seven 4s. Yes, that fits. So the pattern is: replace every consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length. The other numbers remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's check the test input. The test input has multiple lists, and we need to apply this rule to each list. Let's take the third test input line:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs of 6 or more. Here, the sequence of six 1s from position 20 to 25 (indices 21-26 perhaps, considering zero-based or one-based) would be replaced by six 4s.\n\nAnother test line: the fifth input line is [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]. Here, there's a run of ten 8s starting at position 6 (if counting from 0, maybe positions 5 to 14). That would become ten 4s.\n\nAnother example in the test input: the fourth line is [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]. Here, the sequence starting from position 6 (after 8,6) has eight 8s, then after the 16th element, there's a run of seven 1s. Both would be replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the approach is to go through each list in the test input, find all consecutive runs of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each such run with the same number of 4s, and leave the rest as is.\n\nNow, applying this to each test input line. Let's take the first test input line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6+ same numbers. The longest run here is three 3s (positions 2-4), which is less than 6. So no changes. So the output is the same as the input.\n\nSecond test input line:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nAgain, looking for runs of 6+. The longest run is three 8s towards the end (positions 26-28). No changes here either.\n\nThird test input line:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, positions 21-26 (assuming 0-based) have six 1s. So replace those six 1s with six 4s.\n\nFourth line in test input:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking here, the sequence of seven 1s from position 20 to 26 (indices 20-26, assuming 0-based). So replace those seven 1s with seven 4s.\n\nThe fifth test input line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, there's a run of ten 8s starting from position 6 (after 8,6) to position 15. Replace those ten 8s with ten 4s. Then, there's a run of seven 1s starting at position 19. Replace those with seven 4s.\n\nContinuing this process for each line in the test input. The key is to scan each list, identify all consecutive runs of 6 or more, replace them with 4s of the same length. The rest remain as is.\n\nSo the final answer will be each test input list modified according to this rule."
