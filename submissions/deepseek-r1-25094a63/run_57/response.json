        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input has several arrays, and the output seems to have some elements replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nWait, looking at the input here, the fifth element onwards is a sequence of 8s (positions 4 to 9) which in the output become 4s. Similarly, in the next positions (20 to 26 in input, which are 2s), they become 4s. So maybe whenever there's a consecutive sequence of the same number longer than a certain length, it's replaced with 4s? Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at the first array in Example 0's input and output. The input starts with [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,...], and the output is the same. So no changes there. But in the third array, sequences of 8s and 2s are replaced with 4s. Wait, but in the third input array, the first part has eight 8s? Let's check the exact indices.\n\nOriginal input for third array in Example 0:\nInput third array: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\nOutput: [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\n\nSo positions 4-9 (elements 8,8,8,8,8,8) are replaced with six 4s. Then positions 20-26 (elements 2 repeated seven times) become seven 4s. So maybe sequences of 6 or more of the same number are replaced with 4s of the same length. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1. Let's take the third array:\n\nInput third array in Example1: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the input has a sequence of nine 6s starting at position 5. In the output, they are replaced with nine 4s. So that supports the idea that runs of 6 or more identical numbers are replaced with 4s.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's first two input arrays. The first input array doesn't have any runs of 6 or more. The second array in Example0's input is [8,2,1,6,3,1,8,3,1,8,3,8,8,1,3,2,8,3,8,8,3,1,3,1,8,3,2,6,2,6], which in the output remains the same. Because the runs here are 3, 8,3, etc., but none are 6 or longer. So the pattern seems to be: replace any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nBut wait, let's check another example to confirm. Take the third array in Example0's output. The input has seven 2s (positions 20-26) which become seven 4s. So yes, exactly. So the rule is: in each array, if there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, replace each element in that run with 4. The rest remain the same.\n\nNow, let's test this with other examples. Take the fourth array in Example0's input: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]. The output is [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So the 8s from positions 4-9 (six 8s) become 4s, and the 2s from 20-27 (eight 2s) become seven 4s? Wait, in the output array, the 2s are replaced starting at index 20 (assuming 0-based). The input has 20:2, 21:2, etc. up to 26:2 (positions 20-26, which is 7 elements). Then position 27 is also 2. Wait, but in the input, the 2s are from index 20 to 27 (inclusive) which is 8 elements. Let me count:\n\nInput array fourth in Example0:\n\nOriginal elements from index 4 (0-based) to 9: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (6 elements) \u2192 replaced by 4s.\n\nThen, the next run is from index 20 (original element 2) to 27 (elements 2). Let's see:\n\nThe input array is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nSo from index 20 (element at position 20 is 2), then positions 20 to 27: eight 2s. So in the output, that's replaced with 4s. But in the output, it's [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. Wait, the output for that array is:\n\n[1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nWait, the replaced 2s are positions 20-26 (7 elements) replaced with 4s, but the next element at position 27 is 2. Wait, maybe the run is 7 elements. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's see: the array after the first replacement (positions 4-9: 6 elements) then the next part is the 2s starting at index 20. Let's count:\n\nIndices 20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2. So that's 8 elements. But in the output, the replaced part is 20-26 (7 elements) replaced with 4s and position 27 remains 2. That doesn't fit the rule. Hmm. So maybe there's a mistake here, or perhaps the run is exactly 6 or more. Wait, in the output, the 2s from 20-26 are replaced with 4s (7 elements) and the last 2 at position 27 is left as 2. So the run was 8 elements, but in the output, only the first 7 are replaced. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong array.\n\nWait the fourth array in Example0's input is:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nSo the input has a run of 8 elements (positions 20-27) of 2. But the output only replaces 7 of them (positions 20-26) with 4s, leaving the last 2. That would contradict the earlier pattern. So maybe there's a different rule here. Alternatively, perhaps the runs of exactly 6 or more are replaced. Let's check the lengths.\n\nFirst run: 6 elements (positions 4-9: 8s) \u2192 replaced by 4s. Second run: 8 elements (positions 20-27: 2s). The output replaces 7 elements (positions 20-26) with 4s, and the 27th element is 2. So the run is split into two? Maybe the rule is that only runs of exactly 6 or more are replaced. But that would require 8 elements to be replaced. So why is only 7 replaced here?\n\nWait maybe I'm miscalculating the positions. Let's index them properly. Let's list the input array elements step by step.\n\nInput array (fourth example):\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0:1, 1:2, 2:8, 3:1, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:3, 11:8, 12:1, 13:2, 14:1, 15:1, 16:2, 17:3, 18:8, 19:3, 20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2, 28:1, 29:3.\n\nSo positions 4-9: six 8s (indices 4-9 inclusive). Then positions 20-27: 8 elements (indices 20 to 27 inclusive) of 2. The output replaces indices 20-26 with 4s (7 elements) and leaves index 27 as 2. Wait, that's 7 elements. So why? That doesn't fit. Unless the actual rule is to replace runs of exactly 6, and when a run is longer than 6, it's split into multiple runs. But that doesn't seem likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of 6 or more, but only the first 6 elements are replaced. No, in other examples, longer runs are fully replaced. For example, in the third array of Example0's input, a run of seven 2s is replaced with seven 4s.\n\nWait in the third array of Example0's output, the input has 7 2s starting at index 20 (positions 20-26). Output is seven 4s. So that's a run of 7, replaced. But in the fourth array, there's a run of 8 2s (indices 20-27) but the output is seven 4s followed by a 2. That contradicts the pattern. So maybe there's a mistake here, or perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any run of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. But why in the fourth array, the run of 8 2s is replaced with 7 4s? That doesn't fit. Unless I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me check again. The fourth array's input: after index 19 (element 3), the next elements are:\n\n20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2, 28:1, 29:3.\n\nSo indices 20 to 27: 8 elements. But in the output, indices 20 to 26 are 4s (7 elements), and index 27 is 2. That's a problem. Unless perhaps there's a mistake in the example? Or maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait looking at the output for the fourth array:\n\nOutput is [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo from index 20 to 26 (positions 20-26), there are 7 elements replaced. So the original run of 8 elements (indices 20-27) is split into a run of 7 and 1. That's odd. But maybe there's another rule here. For example, perhaps runs are considered only if they are exactly 6 or more, but the replacement is done for the entire run. But why isn't the entire 8-element run replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that only the first run of 6 or more in the array is replaced. But in the third array of Example0, there are two runs (the 8s and the 2s) that are both replaced. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let's look at another example to see.\n\nIn Example0's fifth input array:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\n\nOutput: [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nSo the input has a run of 6 8s (indices 4-9) replaced by 4s. Then a run of 8 2s (indices 20-27) replaced by 7 4s (indices 20-26) and one 3. Wait, no. The output for indices 20-26 are 4s, and index 27 is 3. Wait the original run is 8 2s (indices 20-27). The output has 7 4s and then a 3. That doesn't fit. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of exactly 6 or more elements, but not overlapping. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the runs are replaced only when they are exactly 6, 7, etc. Maybe the replacement is done regardless of the length, as long as it's 6 or more.\n\nWait, looking at Example0's fifth input array:\n\nThe run of 8s (6 elements) is replaced by 4s. The run of 2s is 8 elements (indices 20-27). The output replaces them with 7 4s (indices 20-26) and the last element (index27) is 3. Wait, but the input's index27 is 2. So in the output, it's replaced to 3. But that's part of the original input's next element. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nOriginal input for fifth array:\n\nInput array fifth in Example0:\n\n[3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2]\n\nSo the run of 8s is from index4 to index9: 6 elements. Replaced by 4s. Then, starting at index20 (element 2), there are 8 elements of 2: indices20-27. The output array's elements from 20-26 are 4s, but index27 is 3. Wait, but in the input, index27 is 2, and the output is 3. That's part of the original input's next element. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the output for the fifth array is:\n\n[3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]\n\nSo indices20-26 (7 elements) are 4s, and index27 is 3, which matches the input's index27: 3. Wait, no. The input's index27 is 2. Wait, let's check again.\n\nInput fifth array: after index19 (element 2), the next elements are indices20-29:\n\n20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2, 28:3, 29:6, 30:2.\n\nWait, maybe the array length is 30 elements. So indices 0-29. Let's list:\n\nIndices0-3: 3,3,8,2.\n\nIndices4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8.\n\nIndices10-19:3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2.\n\nIndices20-29:2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,6,2. Wait, but the input array has 30 elements. So indices20-27 are 8 elements of 2 (indices20-27: 8 elements). Then index28 is 3, 29:6, 30:2 (but maybe the array is 30 elements, so up to index29). \n\nThe output array's elements20-26: 4s (7 elements), and element27 is 3, which matches the input's element27:2? No, the input's element27 is 2. Wait, this doesn't make sense. So there's a discrepancy here. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the runs are split. For example, maybe the replacement is applied to the first 6 elements of a run, and the rest remain. But that would mean that a run of 8 would become 6 4s followed by 2 original elements. But in Example0's third array, the run of 8 8s is replaced by 6 4s. Wait, in the third array's input: the 8s are from index4 to 9 (6 elements). So maybe the rule is that runs of exactly 6 elements are replaced. But in that case, the fifth array's run of 8 2s would need to be replaced if the rule is to replace runs of 6 or more. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look for all the changes between input and output in the examples and see if there's a consistent rule.\n\nIn Example0's third input array:\n\nOriginal run of 6 8s \u2192 6 4s.\n\nOriginal run of 7 2s \u21927 4s.\n\nIn the fourth array:\n\nOriginal run of 6 8s \u21926 4s.\n\nOriginal run of 8 2s \u21927 4s and one 2. Hmm, but that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern. Maybe when the run is part of a larger sequence, like if the run is surrounded by certain numbers. Or maybe the replacement is based on the position in the array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace runs of exactly 6, but not longer. But that doesn't fit the third array's run of 7 2s being replaced.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is to replace runs of 6 or more, but if the run is longer than 6, only the first 6 are replaced. No, in the third array, the run of 7 2s is replaced by 7 4s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace any run of 6 or more, regardless of the number. So any sequence of the same number repeated 6 or more times consecutively is replaced with 4s of the same length. That seems to fit most cases. But the fourth array's input has a run of 8 2s which should become 8 4s. But in the output, it's 7 4s. That's a contradiction. So why is that?\n\nWait looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the indices. Let's re-examine the fourth array's input and output.\n\nFourth array input: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nIndices:\n\n0:1, 1:2, 2:8, 3:1, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8, 10:3, 11:8, 12:1,13:2,14:1,15:1,16:2,17:3,18:8,19:3,20:2,21:2,22:2,23:2,24:2,25:2,26:2,27:2,28:1,29:3.\n\nOutput: [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3].\n\nSo indices20-27 in the input are eight 2s. The output's indices20-27 are 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. That's a problem. Because according to the previous pattern, a run of 8 should be replaced with 8 4s. But here it's replaced with 7. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern isn't consistent. Maybe there's a different rule here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a maximum of 7 elements replaced. Or maybe the replacement only happens for even numbers? Or maybe there's a different rule based on the value of the number being replaced. For example, maybe only runs of 8s are replaced with 4s, but others are not. But no, in Example0's third array, 2s are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is to replace the first run of 6 or more in the array. But in the third array, there are two runs replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but only the first such run in each array. Let's check.\n\nIn the third array, two runs are replaced. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of 6 or more in the entire input (across all arrays), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm. This is puzzling. Let's look for another pattern. In Example0's first array, there's no replacement. Second array also no replacement. Third array has two runs replaced. Fourth array has two runs. Fifth array two runs. So it's possible that each array is processed individually, and any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s. But then why in the fourth array's case, the run of 8 2s is partially replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of exactly 6, and longer runs are not replaced. But that doesn't fit the third array's case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but after replacement, the remaining elements of the run are left as is. Wait, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the fourth array's input has a run of 8 2s, but the output shows seven 4s followed by a 2. Maybe there's a mistake in the example's output. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the fourth array's output again.\n\nOriginal input of fourth array: the 2s start at index20 (element 2) and go to index27 (element 2) \u2192 8 elements.\n\nOutput for indices20-27: [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. So seven 4s and one 2. This suggests that the first seven elements of the run are replaced, but the eighth is not. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of 6 or more, but only if they're even numbers. But 8 and 2 are even, but they are being replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts after a certain position in the array. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for runs of 6 or more, but the replacement starts from the first occurrence. For example, if a run is longer than 6, only the first 6 are replaced. But that would mean in a run of 8, the first 6 become 4s and the remaining 2 stay. But in the third array's case, a run of 7 2s is replaced with 7 4s, which contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for all runs of exactly 6 or more, but in some cases, the runs are split into multiple parts. For example, maybe the run is interrupted by another number. But in the fourth array's case, the 2s are consecutive.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to look for another approach.\n\nIn the outputs, the number 4 appears only in positions where there were runs of 6 or more same numbers. For example, in Example0's third array, the runs of 8s and 2s become 4s. So the pattern seems to be: replace any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s. But why in some cases, like the fourth array's 8 2s, the replacement is incomplete?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the replacement is done for runs of exactly 6, and any longer runs are split into chunks of 6 and replaced. But that doesn't fit. For example, a run of 8 would be replaced as 6 4s and 2 original elements. But in the third array's 7 2s, it's replaced with 7 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo in the example. Because the fourth array's output has a run of 7 4s and a 2, which would suggest a run of 7 replaced and one left. But the input's run is 8 elements. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if there's a run of 6 or more, the entire run is replaced with 4s, regardless of its length. That would explain the third array's 7 and 6-element runs being replaced. But then the fourth array's 8-element run should be replaced with 8 4s, but in the output it's 7. So that's a contradiction.\n\nMaybe I need to check other examples. Let's look at Example1's third array:\n\nInput third array in Example1: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nThe input has a run of nine 6s starting at index5. The output has nine 4s. So that fits the pattern of replacing runs of 6+ with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo the only discrepancy is in Example0's fourth array. Maybe that's a mistake in the example, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the fourth array's output again.\n\nInput fourth array: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]\n\nOutput: [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo the run of 8s (6 elements) is replaced, and the run of 8 2s is replaced with 7 4s followed by a 2. Why? Unless the run of 8 2s is somehow considered a run of 7. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm counting. Let's recount the 2s in the fourth array's input. \n\nAfter the 3 at index19, the next elements are indices20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. That's 8 elements. The output for indices20-27: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. That's eight elements. So the run is split into 7 and 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of 6 or more, but after replacement, any remaining elements in the run are left as is. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done from the first element of the run until the sixth, and the rest are left. So for a run of 8, replace first six with 4s, leave the remaining two. But in this case, the output shows seven 4s and one 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts at the beginning of the run and continues for as long as needed to replace exactly six elements. But in a run of 8, replace six, leaving two. But the output has seven 4s, which would suggest that.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given that most examples seem to replace runs of 6 or more with 4s of the same length, perhaps the fourth array's output is a mistake, or perhaps there's a different rule. But since the majority of the examples support the pattern of replacing any run of 6+ same numbers with 4s of the same length, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each array, replace every consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nApplying this to the test input.\n\nNow, the test input is a list of arrays. For each array, we need to look for runs of 6 or more identical numbers and replace them with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs:\n\n- 6: single element.\n- 8: single.\n- 3,3,3: three 3s.\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two 8s.\n- 1: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1,1,1: three 1s.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2,2: two 2s.\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n\nNo runs of 6 or more. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nSecond test input array:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 1: single.\n- 6,6: two 6s.\n- 8,8: two 8s.\n- 1: single.\n- 3,3: two 3s.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two 8s.\n- 2: single.\n- 1,1: two 1s.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8,8: two 8s.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8,8: three 8s.\n- 2: single.\n\nNo runs of 6 or more. So no replacement.\n\nThird test input array:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 8,8: two 8s.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1: six 1s (indices20-25).\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n\nThe run of six 1s (indices20-25) would be replaced with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would be the same as the input, except the six 1s become six 4s.\n\nFourth test input array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 1: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2,2,2: three 2s.\n- 1: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1,1: two 1s.\n- 3: single.\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1: seven 1s (indices20-26).\n\nSo the run of seven 1s would be replaced with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8: ten 8s (indices6-15). This is a run of 10 8s. So replace with ten 4s.\n- 1: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1: seven 1s (indices20-26). Replace with seven 4s.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n\nSo in the fifth array, two runs: ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s, seven 1s \u2192 seven 4s.\n\nSixth test input array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 6: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8: ten 8s (indices6-15).
