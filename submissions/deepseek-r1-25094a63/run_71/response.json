        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input and output have some differences. Let me compare them row by row. For instance, looking at the third input row:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, I notice that starting from the fifth element (index 4), there's a sequence of six 8s in the input. In the output, those six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, later in the input, there are seven 2s starting at index 20, which are replaced with seven 4s in the output. So maybe the rule is that consecutive numbers of length 6 or more are replaced with 4s. Let's check another row.\n\nTake the fourth input row in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\nOutput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\n\nHere again, the sequence of six 8s is replaced by six 4s, and the seven 2s become seven 4s. So the pattern seems to be that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s. Let's confirm with another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input row:\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the sequence of nine 6s is replaced by nine 4s. So the rule seems consistent. Now, checking other rows where the output didn't change, like the first two rows in Example 0, there are no consecutive runs of 6 or more. For example, the first input row in Example 0:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\nOutput: same as input. Let's check the runs here. The longest run is five 3s starting at index 10 (3,3,3,3,3). That's five, which is less than six, so no replacement. Similarly, other runs are three 8s, three 3s, etc. So the rule is: replace all consecutive sequences of six or more of the same number with 4s. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each row and check for consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers. For example, the fifth test input row:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nHere, starting at index 6 (element 8), there's a run of eight 8s. So this should be replaced with 4s. Similarly, later in the row, from index 21 to 26, there are six 1s. Those should also be replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother example is the fourth test input row:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nThe run of eight 8s starting at index 6 (positions 6-15, maybe? Let me count: elements 6 to 15 are eight 8s? Wait, the input is [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...]. Wait, starting at index 6 (element is 8), then next elements are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Wait, from index 6 to index 15 (inclusive), that's 10 elements. So the run is ten 8s. So replace those ten 8s with 4s. Also, later in the row, there's a run of seven 1s starting at index 19. So those would become 4s.\n\nSo applying this to each test input row: check for runs of 6+ same numbers and replace them with 4s. Let's go through each row in the test input and do that.\n\nFor example, the third test input row:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking at index 21: elements from index 21 to 26 are 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace those with 4s. So positions 21-26 become 4s.\n\nAnother example, the fourth test input row:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nStarting at index 6 (element 8), there are ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at index 19, seven 1s: replace with 4s.\n\nAnother test input row is the sixth one:\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs of 6+. The first four 3s are only four, so no. Then from index 4 (element 8), followed by a 3? No. Wait, the fifth element is 8, then 3, then 8s from index 6 onwards. Let's check:\n\nIndices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then later from index 22 to 27: 8,8,8,8,8,8. Six 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nSo for each row in the test input, I need to scan for consecutive runs of the same number that are 6 or longer and replace each element in those runs with 4. The rest remain the same. Let's apply this to all the test input rows."
