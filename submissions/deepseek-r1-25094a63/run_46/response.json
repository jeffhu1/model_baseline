        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to modify some parts of those lists. Let's compare the input and output of the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the third array is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The output for this array is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]. I notice that the sequence of eight 8s starting at position 4 is replaced with six 4s, and the seven 2s starting at position 20 are replaced with seven 4s. Hmm, so maybe consecutive numbers are being replaced with 4s if they meet a certain condition.\n\nLooking at another example, in the first input array of Example 1, the third array input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2], and the output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. Here, the nine 6s starting at position 5 are replaced with nine 4s. So it's replacing a consecutive run of the same number with 4s. But wait, in the first example, the 8s were replaced with 4s, and here the 6s are replaced. So the specific number isn't the key\u2014it's about the length of the consecutive sequence.\n\nWait, let's check more examples. In Example 0's first input array, the original is [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]. The output is the same as the input. So no changes there. The second array in the input of Example 0 is the same in the output. Then the third array starts replacing. So why are some sequences replaced and others not? Maybe the rule is that consecutive numbers longer than a certain length are replaced. Let's check the counts.\n\nIn the third array of Example 0's input, the 8s are six in a row (positions 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8). The output replaces them with six 4s. Then the 2s are seven in a row (positions 20-26: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2) replaced with seven 4s. So perhaps any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s, each replaced with a 4. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, the third input array has nine 6s, which are replaced with nine 4s. Another array in Example 0's input: [8,6,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]. Output has [3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]. So here, the consecutive 3s (positions 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3) are replaced with six 4s. So the pattern seems to be that any run of exactly 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but in the first example's third array, the 8s were 6 in a row, replaced by 6 4s. The 2s were 7, replaced by 7 4s. Similarly in other examples. So the rule is: Whenever there is a consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number, replace each element in that sequence with a 4.\n\nWait, but in Example 0's fourth input array: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]. The output replaces the six 8s with six 4s and the seven 2s with seven 4s. So yes, runs of 6+ are replaced with 4s.\n\nBut then in Example 0's last input array: [1,6,3,1,6,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,8,1,3,3,1,2,6,8,3,1,6,8,3,8,3,1,1,8]. The output is the same as the input. So there are no sequences of 6+ here, hence no replacement.\n\nSo the pattern is: For each consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers in the input array, replace each element in that sequence with the number 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each array in the test input and check for consecutive runs of 6+ same numbers, replacing those with 4s.\n\nLooking at the test input arrays:\n\nFirst test array: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. Let's check for runs of 6. The numbers are 6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6. The longest run here is 3,3,3 (3 times), then 8,8 (twice), etc. No runs of 6. So no replacement. Output same as input.\n\nSecond test array: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. Let's check. The 8,8,8 at the end (positions 26-28: three 8s). No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nThird test array: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, positions 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace with six 4s. So the output would have 4s there.\n\nFourth test array: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. Here, positions 22-28: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. Here, starting at position 6: eight 8s (positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). Wait, that's ten 8s. So replace all ten with 4s. Then positions 20-26: seven 1s (1,1,1,1,1,1,1). Replace with 4s. Then the 8 at position 26 is alone, so remains.\n\nWait, the fifth array's input is:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking at positions 6 to 15: index starts at 0. Let's list them:\n\nIndices 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:8. That's 10 consecutive 8s. So replace with 10 4s. Then indices 20-26 (assuming 0-based) are 1s. Let's check:\n\nOriginal array positions 20-26:\n\n20:1, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:1. So seven 1s. Replace with 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 4s in those positions.\n\nSimilarly, for the sixth test array: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The 8s from position 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 times) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then positions 22-26: five 1s (positions 22-26: 1,1,1,1,1 \u2192 five, which is less than six, so no replacement. Wait, the input here is positions 6-15: 8,6, then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8? Wait, wait, the sixth test array's input is:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nLooking at positions 6 to 15 (indexes 6-15):\n\n6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8 \u2192 10 8s. So replace with 10 4s. Then positions 21-25 (assuming 0-based):\n\n21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1 \u2192 five 1s. Not enough. So no replacement there. The 1s from 16-17 (1,1) are two, no. The 1 at 20 is 6, but 21-25 is five. So no.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 10 4s from positions 6-15.\n\nSimilarly, the seventh test array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. The 8s from position 6 to 15 (indexes 6-15) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 times) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then the 8s at positions 22-27 (eight 8s) \u2192 that's 6 or more, so replace those eight with 4s.\n\nWait, let's check the array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nSo positions 6-15: indexes 6 is 8, then 7-15: eight 8s (since indexes 6-15 is 10 elements). Wait, wait index 6 is 8, then indexes 7 to 15 are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. So that's 10 elements. So replaced with 4s. Then at indexes 22-27 (positions 22 to 27): 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six times), so replace with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 4s in those ranges.\n\nContinuing this process for each test array, replacing any consecutive sequence of 6 or more same numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo the final output for the test input would be each array modified in this way.\n\nLet me verify with another example. Let's take the eighth test input array: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. Here, the 8s from position 6 to 15: that's 10 8s (positions 6-15). Then another 8 at position 16. So 11 8s in a row. So replace all 11 with 4s. Also, positions 25-27: three 8s (no replacement). So the output array would have 4s from 6 to 16 (11 elements) replaced.\n\nAnother example: the ninth test input array: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]. The 8s from position 6-15 (10 elements) and 16-18 (three 8s). So replace the 10 8s with 4s. The three 8s after are left as is.\n\nSo the key is to scan each array for consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers and replace each element in those runs with 4.\n\nNow, applying this to each array in the test input."
