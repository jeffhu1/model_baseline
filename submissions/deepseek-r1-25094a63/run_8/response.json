        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input lists and their corresponding output lists and figure out the transformation that's happening. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input and output. Let's pick one of the input arrays and compare it to the output. For instance, in Example 0, the third input array is:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nAnd the output for this array is:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, I notice that the numbers 8 in positions 4-9 (indexes 4 to 9) of the input are replaced with 4 in the output. Similarly, the 2's from positions 20-26 (indexes 20-26) are replaced with 4's. So maybe consecutive sequences of the same number are being replaced with the count of how many there are in a row? Wait, but 4 is not the count here. In the first case, there are six 8's, but they're replaced with 4. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the number is being replaced with 4 if the length is 6 or more? Wait, 8 occurs six times, so 6 elements replaced by 4. But in another example, like in Example 0's fourth input array:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the 8's from positions 4-9 (6 elements) become 4's, and the 2's from 20-26 (7 elements) become 4's. Wait, 7 elements would be replaced with 4. Hmm. So maybe the replacement is with 4 when there's a run of 6 or more of the same number. Because 6 elements would be replaced with 4. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at another example in Example 1. Take the third input array:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the six 6's starting at position 5 (indices 5 to 13, which is 9 elements) are replaced with 4's. Wait, that's 9 elements. So if it's a run of 6 or more, replace all elements in that run with 4. But why 4? Maybe the length of the run is mapped to a specific number. For example, 6 or more becomes 4. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 0's input arrays, the ones that have runs of 8's or 2's that are long (like 6 or more) are replaced with 4's. Let's confirm another one. Take Example 0's fifth input:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\n\nOutput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6, 2]\n\nHere, the 8's from position 4-9 (6 elements) become 4's, and the 2's from 20-26 (7 elements) become 4's. So again, runs of 6 or more are replaced with 4's. But wait, in the output of the same example, the 2's after position 20 are 7 elements, which are all replaced with 4. So the rule seems to be that any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 6 or longer is replaced with 4's. The same number of elements as the original run, but each element is 4.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the run is exactly 6, and in others longer. So the replacement is for runs of 6 or more. Let's check if that's consistent.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input array:\n\nAnother example in Example 1's input:\n\nInput: [3, 8, 1, 6, 1, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 2, 2, 8, 6]\n\nThe output for this is the same as the input. So maybe there's no run of 6 or more here, which makes sense. So the transformation only applies when a run is 6 or longer.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: In the input array, wherever there is a consecutive run of the same number that is 6 or longer, replace each element in that run with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nLet me check another example to confirm. In Example 1, the 17th input array:\n\nInput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nOutput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nThe run starting at index 13 (assuming 0-based) of eight 8's is replaced with seven 4's. Wait, the original run has seven 8's. Wait, the input here is [8,8,6,6,3,3,2,2,3, followed by eight 8's? Let me check. Wait the input is:\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nSo from index 13 to 19 (positions 14 to 20 in 1-based), there are 7 8's. The output replaces them with 4's. So it's 7 elements replaced with 4's. So the rule is any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number becomes 4's for each element in the run.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is: for each consecutive sequence of the same number in the input, if the length of the sequence is 6 or more, replace each element in the sequence with 4. Otherwise, leave them as is.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input arrays one by one and look for runs of 6 or more.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's scan through:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three 3's \u2192 less than 6\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three 1's\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo runs of 6 here. So this array remains the same.\n\nNext test array:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three\n- 2: single\n\nNo runs of 6 here. So this array remains the same.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nThe run starting at index 20 (assuming 0-based) is 2, then from index 21 to 26 (elements 21-26): six 1's. That's a run of six 1's. So replace them with 4's.\n\nSo positions 21-26 (six elements) become 4's.\n\nOriginal array elements 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1 \u2192 replaced by 4,4,4,4,4,4.\n\nSo the output for this array would be:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3, 6]\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nFrom index 20-26 (assuming 0-based) in the input array: elements are 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1's). So a run of 7, which is >=6. Replace with 4's.\n\nSo positions 20-26: seven 1's \u2192 seven 4's.\n\nThe output array becomes:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3]\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nStarting at position 6 (element 7 in 1-based), there's a run of 8's from index 6 to 15 (elements 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8) \u2192 10 elements. So replace all with 4's.\n\nAlso, after that, there's a run of 1's from index 19-25 (elements 20-26 in 1-based): seven 1's. Replace those with 4's.\n\nSo the output array would be:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6, 8]\n\nWait, wait, let's check indices correctly. The array is 30 elements. Let's index from 0.\n\nOriginal array:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:8, 16:1, 17:3, 18:8, 19:1, 20:1, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:8, 27:3, 28:6, 29:8.\n\nSo the run of 8's starts at index 6 (element 6) and continues through index 15. That's 10 elements (indices 6-15 inclusive). So replace all 10 with 4's.\n\nThen the run of 1's starts at index 19 (element 19) with 1, and continues through index 25. That's 7 elements (indices 19-25). Replace with 4's.\n\nSo the output array becomes:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nWait, but index 19 is 1, and the run is from 19 to 25 (inclusive). So that's 7 elements. So those seven 1's become 4's.\n\nSo the element at index 26 is 8, which remains.\n\nSo the fifth test array output would be as above.\n\nContinuing this way for all test input arrays. For each array, scan for runs of 6 or more same numbers, replace each element in such runs with 4.\n\nNow, let's proceed to process the entire test input.\n\nAnother example in the test input:\n\nThe sixth test array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nCheck for runs. The 8's from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) \u2192 replace with 4's.\n\nThen, the 1's from index 21 to 25 (5 elements) \u2192 not 6, so no replacement.\n\nSo output array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nNext array:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nFirst, the 3's at the start: indices 0-3 (four 3's) \u2192 no. Then 8 at index4, then 3 at index5. Then from index6 to index15: 8's (10 elements). Replace with 4's. Then at index16: 1, 3, etc. Also, towards the end, from index22 to 27: 8's (6 elements). So that's another run of six 8's. So replace those with 4's.\n\nSo the output array would be:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3]\n\nAnd so on. The key is to check each array for runs of 6 or more and replace each element in those runs with 4.\n\nApplying this to all test input arrays, each array in the test input needs to be processed by replacing any consecutive sequences of the same number (length \u22656) with 4's."
