        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this pattern. Looking at the training examples, especially the first one. The input and output arrays are mostly the same except for certain sections where numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me check where those 4s appear.\n\nIn Example 0, the third input line is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]. The output changes the sequence of 8s starting at position 4 to 4s. So the original has eight 8s in a row starting at index 4, and they become 4s. Wait, but in the output, those six 8s become six 4s. Wait, the input has 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six times), and the output replaces them with 4,4,4,4,4,4. So the same length. Similarly, looking at the next line in the input: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,...], and the output replaces those six 8s with six 4s. So the pattern seems to be that consecutive 8s (maybe of a certain length?) are replaced with 4s. Wait, but in some cases, like the next example, maybe it's not 8s. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at the second training example, Example 1. The third input line is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,...]. The output replaces the consecutive 6s starting at index 5 (positions 5 to 13) with 4s. There are 9 6s here, but in the output, they become 9 4s. Wait, but in the output, the 6s are replaced with 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s of the same length?\n\nWait, in Example 0, the third input line has six 8s, replaced by six 4s. The next line in that example has six 8s again, replaced by six 4s. Then another line with six 8s replaced by 4s. But in the 8th input line of Example 0, there's a sequence like [8,8,8,8,8,8] (six 8s) in the input, but in the output, they're replaced by 4s. Wait, but looking at other parts of the input in Example 0, like the 12th input line: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output for this line has [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,... 8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. So the original here has a run of six 3s (positions 20-25) which are replaced by six 4s. So that's a run of six 3s. So the pattern isn't just 8s, but any run of six or more same numbers being replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 0's 13th input line: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]. The output replaces the six 3s at the end (positions 22-27) with 4s. So that's a run of six 3s. So the rule seems to be that any consecutive run of exactly six identical numbers is replaced by six 4s. But wait, in Example 1, the third input line has nine 6s, but in the output they are replaced by nine 4s. So maybe it's runs of six or more? Or exactly six?\n\nWait, let's check. In Example 1, third input line's output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,...]. The original had nine 6s, which are replaced by nine 4s. So if it's runs of six or more, they become 4s. Then the rule is: wherever there's a consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number, replace each of those numbers with a 4.\n\nBut let me check another example. In Example 0's 17th input line: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]. The output replaces the seven 1s (positions 10-16) with seven 4s. So that's a run of seven 1s. So the rule is indeed: any consecutive run of 6 or more same numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nSo the transformation is to scan the array and replace every consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s, maintaining the same length of the sequence.\n\nNow, let's check the test input. The test input has several lines. For each line, we need to check if there's a run of six or more same numbers and replace them with 4s.\n\nLooking at the test input lines:\n\nFirst line: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. I don't see any runs of 6 same numbers here. The longest run is three 3s at the start. So no changes.\n\nSecond line: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. The last three 8s, but that's three. No runs of six.\n\nThird line: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, positions 21-26 are six 1s. So replace these six 1s with six 4s.\n\nFourth line: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. Positions 21-27: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth line: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The 8s from positions 6 to 15: ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nSixth line: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The 8s from positions 6 to 15: ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nSeventh line: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. The 8s from position 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Also, the 8s at positions 22-27 are six 8s. Replace those as well. Then the 1 at the end, but that's single.\n\nEighth line: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8s from position 6 to 16: 11 8s. Replace with 4s. Then three 8s at the end, but that's less than six.\n\nNinth line: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]. The 8s from positions 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTenth line: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]. The 8s from positions 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nEleventh line: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]. The 8s from positions 5 to 15: 11 8s. Replace with 4s. Then three 1s at the end, not enough.\n\nTwelfth line: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]. No runs of six here.\n\nThirteenth line: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]. The 2s at positions 10-13: four 2s. Not enough. The three 3s at 14-16: three. So no changes.\n\nFourteenth line: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]. The two 3s at the end: two. Not enough.\n\nFifteenth line: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]. Three 8s at 18-20, three 3s elsewhere. No runs of six.\n\nSixteenth line: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]. The three 3s here and there. No six.\n\nSeventeenth line: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]. The 8s at 20-22: three. Not enough.\n\nEighteenth line: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]. No runs of six.\n\nNineteenth line: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]. The 3s at 5-6: two. No.\n\nTwentieth line: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. The six 3s starting at position 12 (assuming indices start at 0). From positions 11-16: 3,3,3,3,6... wait, no. Wait the input line is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Let's count:\n\nLooking at the sequence starting at position 10 (0-based): 3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3. Wait, position 10 is 3, 11:3, 12:3, 13:3, 14:6. So that's four 3s. Then positions 15-20: 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six 3s. So starting at position 15, six 3s. Replace those with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-first line: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. At positions 16-21: six 3s (from 3,3,3,3,3,3). Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second line: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]. From position 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-third line: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]. The six 3s at positions 16-21. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fourth line: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]. The six 3s from 16-21 and then another one, making seven. Replace those seven with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth line: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]. The seven 3s from positions 16-22. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth line: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]. The six 3s starting at position 14 (assuming 0-based: positions 13-18? Let's see. The line is: ...,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2... So from position 13 (value 3) onwards: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (eight 3s). So replace those eight 3s with 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh line: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]. The five 3s from position 8-12? No, let's see. The line is [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,...]. The 3s at 0-1: two. Then after 8,8, 3,3,3 (positions 7-9: three 3s). Then later, 3,3,3,3,3 (positions 13-17: five 3s). Not six. So no replacement here.\n\nTwenty-eighth line: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]. The three 6s at start. Then 3,3,3 at positions 2-4. No six.\n\nTwenty-ninth line: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]. The four 3s at positions 6-9. Not six.\n\nThirtieth line: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]. No runs of six.\n\nSo applying the pattern to each line of the test input, we replace any consecutive sequences of six or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length. Let's apply this to each line.\n\nFor example, the fifth line in the test input is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The 8s from position 6 to 15 (10 numbers) become ten 4s. Then the seven 1s at positions 20-26 become seven 4s. Wait, in this line, after the initial 8,6, the 8s start at position 6 (0-based index 6). Let me count:\n\nOriginal line:\nIndices 0-29:\n0:8\n1:1\n2:2\n3:3\n4:8\n5:6\n6:8\n7:8\n8:8\n9:8\n10:8\n11:8\n12:8\n13:8\n14:8\n15:8\n16:1\n17:3\n18:8\n19:1\n20:1\n21:1\n22:1\n23:1\n24:1\n25:1\n26:8\n27:3\n28:6\n29:8\n\nSo positions 6 to 15 (indices 6-15 inclusive) are 10 8s. So replace all with 4s. Then positions 20-26 (indices 20-26) are seven 1s. Replace those with 4s.\n\nSo the output line would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nAnd similarly for other lines where there are runs of six or more.\n\nNow, applying this to all test input lines. Each line must be processed to find runs of 6+ same numbers and replace each element in the run with 4."
