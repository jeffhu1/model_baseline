        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let me start by looking at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output lists. Let's compare them. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nI notice that starting from index 4 to 9 (positions 5 to 10 if counting from 1), there's a sequence of eight 8s in the input that are replaced by 4s. Similarly, in the output, the 2s from index 20 to 26 (positions 21 to 27) are replaced by 4s. So maybe there's a rule where consecutive numbers are replaced by 4s if they meet certain conditions.\n\nLooking at another example in Example 0. Let's take the fourth input list:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the same pattern. The 8s in positions 5-10 (indices 4-9) are replaced by 4s. The 2s in positions 21-27 (indices 20-26) are replaced by 4s. But wait, the replacement is to 4s. So the rule might be that any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced by 4s. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the eighth input list:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\n\nOutput is the same as input. So there's no replacement here. That's because there are no consecutive runs of six or more. Let's check another example where the replacement occurs.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input list:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the sixes starting from index 5 (sixth position) for 9 elements (since 6 repeated 9 times) are replaced by 4s. So it's a run of 9 6s turned into 4s. So the pattern is that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s for the entire run. The number of replacements is the same as the length of the original run. For example, in the first example, the run of 6 8s becomes 6 4s.\n\nWait, but in the first example I looked at, the input had 6 8s (indices 4-9, which is 6 elements) and they became 6 4s. In another part of the same input, there was a run of 7 2s (indices 20-26, which is 7 elements) replaced by 7 4s. So the rule is: any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nSo the transformation is: wherever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, replace each element in that run with 4. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nLet me verify with more examples. In Example 1, the 17th input list (index 16 perhaps? Let me check):\n\nInput (from Example 1's input list 17):\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nOutput becomes:\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nHere, the input had a run of 7 8s (positions starting at index 13 to 19, 7 elements), replaced by 7 4s. So yes, that fits the pattern.\n\nAnother example: in the 20th input list of Example 1's test case:\n\nInput: [3, 6, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 2, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [3, 6, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the input has a run of 3 6s (positions 6-8) but that's only 3 elements, so not replaced. However, the 8s starting at position 13 are a run of 7, so replaced by 4s. Wait, but in the input, the run at positions 6-8 (indices 5-7 perhaps?) is 6,6,6. That's three elements. Then the 8s from 13-19 (indices 12-19) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (7 elements), replaced by 4s. So the rule is that runs of 6 or more are replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each list, any consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers is replaced with the same number of 4s.\n\nTherefore, the task is to process each list in the test input, find all consecutive runs of 6 or more identical numbers, and replace each element in those runs with 4.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs of 6 or more. Let's scan through:\n\n- 6: single, no run.\n- 8: single.\n- 3,3,3: three 3s. Not enough.\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two 8s.\n- 1: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1,1,1: three 1s.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2,2: two 2s.\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n\nNo runs of 6 here, so the output is the same as input.\n\nSecond test input list:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs of 6:\n\n- 1: single.\n- 6,6: two.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 1: single.\n- 3,3: two.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 2: single.\n- 1,1: two.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8,8: three.\n\nNo runs of 6, so output same.\n\nThird test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. The part at indices 21-26 (assuming 0-based):\n\n2,1,1,1,1,1,1: Wait, the elements here are 1,1,1,1,1,1, which is six 1s. So that's a run of six 1s. So these six 1s should be replaced by six 4s. Let's check the positions. Original list:\n\nIndices 21-26 (assuming 0-based):\n\nWait the list is:\n\nIndex 0:8,1:8,2:3,3:6,4:3,5:1,6:6,7:8,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:3,12:1,13:2,14:8,15:1,16:8,17:2,18:1,19:3,20:2,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:8,28:3,29:6.\n\nSo from index 21 to 26 (elements 1,1,1,1,1,1), that's six 1s. So replace these six 1s with 4s. The output for this list would have 4s in positions 21-26.\n\nFourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check:\n\nAt the end of the list: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). Starting from index 20 (element 21 if 1-based), seven 1s. So replace these seven 1s with 4s.\n\nSo indices 20-26 (0-based) would be replaced by seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The part starting at index 4 (element 5 if 0-based) is 8, followed by 6, then from index 6 (element 7) onwards: 8 repeated multiple times. Let's count:\n\nFrom index 6 to 15 (assuming 0-based):\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Wait the input list is:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nIndices 6-15 (elements 7-16 in 1-based) are eight 8s? Let's count:\n\nStarting at index 6: 8,6 is index 5. Wait, index 4 is 8, index 5 is 6. So after that, index 6 is 8, followed by 8s up to index 15. Let's count from index 6 (element 7 of the list) to index 15 (element 16):\n\nelements:\n\nindex 6:8, 7:8, 8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8 \u2192 that's 10 consecutive 8s (from index6 to 15 inclusive). So a run of 10 8s. So replace all with 4s.\n\nThen, after that, there's a run of 7 1s (indices 19-25: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1). So replace those with 4s.\n\nSo the output for this list would have 10 4s from index6 to15 and 7 4s from 19-25.\n\nProceeding similarly for each test input list. The key is to scan each list and replace any consecutive runs of 6+ same numbers with 4s of the same length."
