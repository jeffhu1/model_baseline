        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples to understand what's going on. \n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a series of lists of numbers, and the output seems to replace certain sequences with 4s. Let's compare the input and output for each list.\n\nTake the third input list in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, starting at position 4 (0-based index?), the sequence of eight 8s becomes six 4s. Wait, the input has six 8s there (positions 4-9), and the output replaces them with six 4s. Similarly, the sequence of seven 2s starting at position 20 (input indices 20-26) is replaced by seven 4s.\n\nWait, but the input here for the 8s is 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), but the output replaces them with six 4s. So maybe when there's a run of six or more of the same number, they are replaced by 4s for the entire run? Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input list:\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the input has nine 6s starting at position 5. The output replaces them with nine 4s. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at another list in Example 0's input:\nInput: [3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 6, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2]\nOutput: [3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 6, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]\n\nIn the input, there's a run of five 3s (positions 22-26), but in the output, they are replaced by five 4s. Wait, but five is less than six. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea. Wait, let me check again. The input here for that part is 3,3,3,3,3, which is five 3s. The output replaces them with five 4s. But according to the first examples, maybe the threshold is five or more. Let's check another case.\n\nIn Example 0's input list 0:\nInput: [3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\nOutput is the same as input. So there's a run of three 8s, but in the output, they remain. So perhaps the threshold is runs of exactly five or more? Or maybe six?\n\nWait, in the third list of Example 0's input, the run of 6 8s is replaced by 4s. Another example in Example 0's input is list 2, where a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. But in list 0, there's a run of three 8s which remains. So maybe the rule is that runs of exactly six or more are replaced by 4s. But in the fifth example list of Example 0:\n\nInput list 5 in Example 0:\nInput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\nOutput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6, 2]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s (positions 4-9) and eight 2s (positions 20-27). Both are replaced by 4s. So the pattern seems to be that any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's confirm this with another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input list:\nInput: [6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2]\nOutput is the same as input. So the runs here are four 8s (positions 4-7), which are not replaced. So the threshold is six. So whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's check another example where the run is exactly five. For instance, in Example 0's input list 12:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nThe input here has a run of six 3s (positions 22-27), which are replaced by six 4s.\n\nWait, the run in positions 22-27 is 3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2014 that's six 3s. So yes, replaced with six 4s.\n\nWhat about a run of exactly five? Let's see. For example, in Example 0's input list 0, there's a run of five 3s (positions 10-14). In the output, they remain 3s. So that confirms that the threshold is six. Only runs of six or more are replaced by 4s. So, the rule is: In the input list, any consecutive sequence of the same number that is six or longer is replaced with the same number of 4s in the output.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input. For each list in the test input, I need to look for consecutive runs of six or more of the same number and replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow let's look at the Test Input. Let's take the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs. Let's check each number:\n\n6, then 8, then three 3s (length 3), then 8, etc. No runs of six here.\n\nSecond test input list:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck consecutive runs: 6,6 (length 2); 8,8 (length 2); 3,3 (length 2); 8,8,8 (length 3). No runs of six here.\n\nThird test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking at positions 20-25: 1,1,1,1,1,1 \u2014 six 1s. So this should be replaced by six 4s.\n\nFourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, from position 20 to 26: seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nStarting at position 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15: 10 8s). Replace with ten 4s. Then after that, there's a run of seven 1s at positions 19-25. Replace with seven 4s. The 8 at position 26 remains.\n\nSixth test input list:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nStarting at position 6: eight 8s (positions 6-15: 10 8s?), let's count: 8,8,8,8 (positions 6-9), 8,8,8,8 (10-13), 8,8 (14-15). Wait, positions 6 to 15 (assuming 0-based) would be indices 6 to 15 inclusive. So 10 elements. So ten 8s. So replace with ten 4s. Then, there's a run of five 1s (positions 21-25) which is five, so not replaced. The 6 at position 26 is a single.\n\nSeventh test input list:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nAt position 0-3: four 3s (no). Then at position 4: 8, followed by 3 (position 5). Then from position 6 (8) to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements?), so ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Then positions 22-27: eight 8s. So replace those with eight 4s.\n\nWait, the input here is:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nSo positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). Then positions 22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). So both of those runs should be replaced by 4s.\n\nEighth test input list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nStarting at position 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-16: 11 8s). Replace with 11 4s. Then positions 25-27: three 8s (no replacement).\n\nNinth test input list:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nFrom position 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15: 10 8s).

No replacement.\n\nEighteenth test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 6, 1]\n\nRuns: 8,8 (twice), three 3s. No six.\n\nNineteenth test input list:\n\n[3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 8]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nTwentieth test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\n\nLooking at the numbers: 3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3. Wait, from position 10 (assuming 0-based) is 3,3,3,3,6,... So that's four 3s, then a 6, then six 3s. So the six 3s (positions 14-19) would be replaced by six 4s. Wait, let's check:\n\nThe list is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8].\n\nWait, positions 10-13: 3,3,3,3 (four 3s). Then position 14 is 6, then positions 15-20: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). So that's six 3s. So replace with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. At positions 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). Replace with six 4s. Also, the 8,8,8 at positions 24-26 (three 8s). No replacement.\n\nTwenty-second test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nHere, positions 16-22: seven 3s (3,3,3,3,3,3,3). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test input list:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 15-20: six 3s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-fourth test input list:\n\n[1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\n\nPositions 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\n\nPositions 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s. Then positions 23-26: 3,3,3,8, etc. So 3 is at position 23, but after replacement, the previous part would have been handled.\n\nTwenty-sixth test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\n\nPositions 14-21: eight 3s. Replace with eight 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test input list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8,8 (positions 5-6). Then a run of five 3s (positions 7-11: 3,3,3). No, that's three. Then positions 14-18: five 3s. Not enough. No replacement.\n\nTwenty-eighth test input list:\n\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\n\nRuns: four 8s (positions 8-11). No replacement.\n\nTwenty-ninth test input list:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\n\nRuns: four 3s (positions 6-9). No replacement.\n\nThirtieth test input list:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nSo, applying the pattern, all consecutive runs of six or more of the same number are replaced by 4s of the same length. Now, I need to process each test input list accordingly and output the transformed lists.\n\nLet me start with the third test input list, which has a run of six 1s. For example:\n\nOriginal list: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nThe run of six 1s is at positions 20-25 (0-based). So replace those six 1s with six 4s. The rest remain the same.\n\nSo the output for this list would be:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 3, 6]\n\nSimilarly, for the fourth test input list:\n\nOriginal: [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nThe run of seven 1s is at positions 20-26. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nOutput: [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3]\n\nContinuing this process for each list in the test input, replacing any runs of six or more with 4s. The key is to check each consecutive sequence and replace only those of length six or more."
