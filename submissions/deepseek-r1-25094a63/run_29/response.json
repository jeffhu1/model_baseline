        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's start by looking at the training examples to understand what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to have some numbers replaced with 4s. Let's compare a few rows.\n\nTake the third input list in Example 0:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe corresponding output is:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nI notice that in the input, starting from index 4 (the fifth element), there are six 8s in a row. In the output, those six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, the next part from index 20 (the 21st element) has seven 2s. Those are replaced with seven 4s. So, sequences of consecutive identical numbers longer than a certain length are replaced with 4s. Let me check other examples to confirm.\n\nLooking at another example in Example 0: the second input list's output. The input had [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...]. The output starts [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,...]. So here, six 8s are replaced by six 4s. Similarly, later in the same list, there's a sequence of seven 2s which becomes seven 4s. So it seems like whenever there's a run of 6 or more of the same number, they get replaced by 4s. Let me check another example to be sure.\n\nLooking at Example 1, take the third input row:\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nThe output here is:\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, there's a run of nine 6s starting at position 5 (index 5), which becomes nine 4s. So the pattern is replacing consecutive runs of 6 or more of the same number with 4s. The length of the run must be exactly 6 or more. Let's check if that's consistent across all examples.\n\nAnother example from Example 1: the 17th input list (assuming 0-based index) in the input for Example 1 is:\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nThe output replaces the seven 8s starting at position 13 (index 13) with 4s. So again, a run of 7 (which is >=6) is replaced by 4s. \n\nSo the rule seems to be: in the input list, any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 6 or longer in length is replaced with the same number of 4s in the output. All other numbers remain unchanged. \n\nLet me test this against the first example. Take the first input list in Example 0. Its output is the same as the input. Let's check the input: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]. The runs here are 2 3s, 3 8s, etc. All runs are less than 6, so they stay the same. So the output is identical, which matches. Similarly, the second input in Example 0's input has a run of 3 8s, which isn't long enough, so it remains. But in the third input list, there's a run of 6 8s (positions 4-9) which becomes 6 4s. \n\nSo the pattern is confirmed. Now, applying this to the test input. \n\nLet's look at the test input provided. Each line is a list. For each list, we need to replace any consecutive runs of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s. Let's go through each line of the test input:\n\nTest Input line 0: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check each element:\n\n6, 8, 3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6.\n\nThe runs here are:\n- 3,3,3 (length 3)\n- 8,8 (length 2)\n- 1,1,1 (length 3)\n- 2,2 (length 2)\nNo runs of 6 or more. So the output is same as input.\n\nTest Input line 1: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck runs:\n1, then 6,6 (length 2), 8,8 (2), 1, 3,3 (2), 6, 3, 8,8 (2), 2, 1,1 (2), 3, 6, 8,8 (2), 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8,8,8 (3), 2. No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nTest Input line 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence from index 20 (assuming 0-based) is 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So this is a run of 6. These six 1s should become six 4s. The rest of the elements remain. So in the output, positions 20-25 (indices 20-25) become 4s.\n\nTest Input line 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. Starting from index 20 (element 21 in 1-based?), there's a run of seven 1s (positions 20-26: elements 1,1,1,1,1,1,1). That's seven, so replace with 4s. So indices 20-26 (assuming 0-based) would be replaced by seven 4s.\n\nTest Input line 4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking for runs. Starting at index 6 (element 7): 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's a run of 10 8s. So replace all with 4s. Then, at index 19 (element 20), there's a run of seven 1s. So those become 4s as well.\n\nTest Input line 5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nCheck runs. Starting at index 6: eight 8s (length 9?), but let's count. From index 6 (element 7) to 15 (element 16): 8,6 followed by 8s? Wait, the input line is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,...]. So after 8,6 comes 8,8,... (from index 6: the element is 8, then eight 8s, making a total of 9 8s (indices 6 to 14, assuming 0-based). That's a run of 9 8s, so replaced by 9 4s. Then later, indices 20-25 (elements 21-26): six 1s, which would be replaced by 4s.\n\nTest Input line 6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nFirst, check the start: four 3s (length 4), then 8,3, followed by a run of 9 8s (from index 6 to 14?), then 1,3, etc. The 9 8s become 4s. Also, at the end, there's a run of six 8s (indices 22-27?), which would be replaced.\n\nWait, let's parse line 6 correctly:\n\nInput line 6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nIndices 0-3: four 3s (not enough). Then 8,3 (so single 8). Then starting at index 6 (element 7): 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (indices 6-14: 9 elements) all 8s. That's a run of 9, replaced by 4s. Then after index 15, elements 1,3, etc. Then at index 22 (element 23): eight, eight, ..., up to index 27 (element 28): six 8s. So that's six 8s, replaced by six 4s. Then 1 and 3.\n\nTest Input line 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nCheck runs: From index 6 (element 7) to index 15 (element 16): 10 8s. So replaced by 4s. Then at index 24 (element 25), there's a run of three 8s (elements 25-27), which is less than 6. So only the first run is replaced.\n\nTest Input line 8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nHere, from index 6 (element 7) to 15 (element 16): 9 8s (replaced by 4s). Then later, 6, then 8,8,8 (length 3). So replaced.\n\nTest Input line 9: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nThe run here is from index 6 to 15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced by 4s. Then, at the end, three 8s (length 3), so unchanged.\n\nTest Input line 10: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nThe run starts at index 5 (element 6) as 8s. Let's count. From index 5: 8,8,... up to index 14: that's 10 8s. Then element 15 is 8, so that's 11 8s in a row. All replaced by 4s. Then, at index 25 (element 26), there's three 1s (length 3). So only the first run is replaced.\n\nTest Input line 11: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nLooking for runs. The run of 3 2s at the end (elements 28-30) is length 3. Other runs are shorter. So no changes.\n\nTest Input line 12: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nCheck runs.

The sequence starting at index 16 (element 17): 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s). So replaced by seven 4s.\n\nTest Input line 22: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\n\nCheck runs. The sequence starting at index 16 (element 17): six 3s (indices 16-21). Replace with 4s. Then two 8s, etc.\n\nTest Input line 23: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nHere, the run of seven 3s starting at index 16 (element 17) \u2192 replaced by seven 4s.\n\nTest Input line 24: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n\nCheck runs. The sequence starting at index 16 (element 17): seven 3s (indices 16-22). Replace with 4s. Later, three 3s, etc.\n\nTest Input line 25: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n\nCheck runs. The sequence of eight 3s starting at index 13 (element 14): eight 3s (indices 13-20). Replace with 4s. Then two 2s, etc.\n\nTest Input line 26: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nCheck runs. The sequence of six 3s starting at index 13 (element 14): 3,3,3,3,3,3. Replace with 4s. Then 6, 8, etc.\n\nTest Input line 27: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\n\nCheck runs. The four 8s (indices 8-11) \u2192 length 4. No runs \u22656. So output same.\n\nTest Input line 28: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\n\nCheck runs. The four 3s (indices 6-9) \u2192 length 4. So no change.\n\nTest Input line 29: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n\nCheck runs. The two 8s (indices 7-8), etc. No runs \u22656. So output same.\n\nSo, for each line in the test input, we need to replace any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s. Now, apply this rule to each line and generate the output."
