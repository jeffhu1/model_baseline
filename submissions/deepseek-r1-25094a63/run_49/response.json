        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output lists have the same numbers except some sequences are replaced with 4s. Let's compare the input and output of the first example.\n\nTake Example 0's first input array:\n[3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, ...]\nThe output is the same except starting from the fifth element, there's a sequence of 8,8,8,2, which stays the same. Wait, no, looking further, in some parts of the input, the output replaces a consecutive sequence with 4s. For instance, in the third line of input in Example 0, the input has [1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, ...], and the output replaces those six 8s with 4s. Wait, the input line is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, ...], and the output is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, ...]. So the consecutive six 8s are replaced with six 4s. \n\nBut wait, the input in that position is actually 8,8,8,8,8,8. So six 8s. The output replaces them with 4s. Similarly, looking at other lines in the example, whenever there's a consecutive run of six or more of the same number, they are replaced by 4s for the length of six. Wait, in the third input line of Example 0, the 8s are six in a row. The output replaces them with six 4s. Then, another part of the input has seven 2s (like [1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1] in the first input array?), but the output replaces the seven 2s starting at position 20 with seven 4s. Wait, looking at the first input array in Example 0, the input is [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]. The output for this is the same as the input. So maybe the first two lines in the input are left as-is. Then the third input line in Example 0 has a run of six 8s. So perhaps the rule is: in each array, when there's a run of exactly six identical numbers, replace them with six 4s. But wait, in the fourth input line of Example 0, the input is [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]. The output is [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3, 8, ...]. The input here has six 8s (positions 4-9), which are replaced by 4s. Then later in the same array, there are seven 2s (positions 20-26). The output replaces the first six 2s with 4s and leaves the seventh as 2? Let me check. The input has 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (seven 2s). The output is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, the output shows [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2]. Wait, no, the input in the fourth line's array from position 20 is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2. The output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, that's seven elements. So replacing seven 2s with seven 4s? But in the first example, the third input line had six 8s replaced by six 4s. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s for the entire run. But wait, in the fourth input line of Example 0, the seven 2s are replaced by seven 4s. Wait, the output shows seven 4s followed by 2. Wait, but in the input, the 2s are from position 20: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (seven 2s). The output for that line's array is: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]. So the seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. So that suggests that if there's a run of six or more of the same number, replace all of them with 4s. Because six or more. Let's check another example. In Example 0's input line 12: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output for this line is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. The original input has six 3s starting at position 22 (3,3,3,3,3,3). The output replaces those six with four 4s? Wait, no, the output shows 4,4,4,4,4, which is five 4s. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, original input line 12 in Example 0 is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. Wait, the input has six 3s from position 22 to 27 (indices maybe starting at 0?), but the output replaces them with five 4s. Wait, that doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let's count: positions after 8,3: the next elements are 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six 3s. The output replaces them with four 4s. Wait, in the output, from position 22 (assuming the array is 30 elements long), it's 8,3, then 4,4,4,4,4 (five 4s), then 1. Wait, that's five 4s. So that's not matching. Wait, maybe the pattern isn't about runs of exactly six. Let's check other examples. Maybe the rule is different. Let's look at Example 1. In Example 1's input line 2: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. Here, the input has nine 6s, which are replaced with nine 4s. So the rule could be: replace all consecutive runs of the same number with 4s if the run length is six or more. Wait, but in Example 0's input line 12, there are six 3s, but the output replaced them with five 4s. That's conflicting. Hmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the first occurrence of a run of six in the array is replaced with 4s. Let me check. Wait, in Example 0's line 12, maybe the six 3s are replaced with five 4s. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that any run of exactly six is replaced with six 4s. But in that line, there's a run of six 3s. The output shows five 4s. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again. Original input line 12 in Example 0 is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. Let's count from index 20 (assuming 0-based):\n\nIndices 20: 8,3 (elements 20 and 21?), then elements 22-27 (indices 22 to 27) are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output for this line is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. So elements 22-27 in the output are 4,4,4,4,4,1. Wait, that's five 4s followed by 1. But the original six 3s are replaced by five 4s and the 1. That's not matching. So perhaps there's a different rule. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is that any run of six or more is replaced by 4s for the first six elements. Wait, in that case, a run of seven would be replaced by six 4s. But in Example 0's line 4, the input has seven 2s, which are replaced by seven 4s. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done when there's a run of six or more of the same number, but the replacement is that all elements in the run are replaced with 4s. Let's check that. For Example 0's line 3 input: [1,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3]. The output is [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]. The input has six 8s (positions 4-9) replaced by six 4s, and seven 2s (positions 20-26) replaced by seven 4s. So that fits. Then in line 12, the six 3s are replaced by six 4s. Wait, but in the output, line 12's array after 8,3, the next elements are 4,4,4,4,4,1. So that's five 4s. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my observation. Let me recheck that line. Input line 12 in Example 0: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. So the input here has six 3s starting at index 22 (elements 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3). The output replaces them with five 4s followed by 1. Wait, that's not matching. So perhaps there's an error in the pattern. Maybe there's another factor. Let me look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at the first two lines of Example 0's input and output: they are identical. So perhaps the rule applies only to certain arrays. Maybe the rule is applied to every array except the first two. Wait, no. In Example 0, there are 28 input arrays. The output for the first two are the same as input. The third input array has a run of six 8s which are replaced with six 4s. So maybe the pattern is that in each array, after the first two elements, if there's a run of six or more of the same number, replace them with 4s. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that in each array, the first occurrence of a run of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s. But that's not consistent with line 4 where there are two such runs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of exactly six. Let's check. Example 0's third input line has six 8s: replaced with six 4s. Fourth input line has six 8s (replaced) and seven 2s (replaced with seven 4s). So that's not exactly six. Hmm. Maybe the rule is that any run of six or more is replaced by 4s for the entire run. So in that case, runs of six, seven, etc., all get replaced. Then in line 12, the six 3s should be replaced with six 4s. But in the output, there's five 4s. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in how I'm counting. Let me recount. The input line 12 in Example 0 is:\n\nInput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nOutput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nLooking at the elements after index 21 (assuming 0-based):\n\nInput elements 22-27: positions 22 to 27 (six elements) are all 3s. So six 3s. The output has elements 22-27: 4,4,4,4,4,1. Wait, that's five 4s followed by a 1. That can't be right. So perhaps there's an error in the example, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the pattern. Alternatively, maybe the replacement starts after a certain position. Or maybe the run must be exactly six. But in that case, the seventh element in the fourth line's input (seven 2s) would be replaced by six 4s and one 2. But in the output, all seven are replaced with 4s. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that the first run of six or more in each array is replaced with 4s. Let's see. In Example 0, line 3 has six 8s (replaced), line 4 has six 8s replaced and seven 2s replaced. Wait, but in line 3's output, after replacing six 8s, the next run of seven 2s is also replaced. So that's two replacements in the same array. So the rule can't be first run only. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is that any consecutive sequence of six identical numbers is replaced with six 4s, regardless of their position in the array. Let me check Example 0's line 12. The input has a run of six 3s. The output replaces them with five 4s and leaves one 3? That doesn't fit. Unless there's a mistake in my counting. Let me list the input and output arrays for line 12:\n\nInput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\nOutput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nWait, the input's elements starting at position 22 (assuming 0-based) are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (positions 22-27). The output for positions 22-27 is 4,4,4,4,4,1. Wait, that's six elements. The input's six 3s are replaced with five 4s and a 1. That doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern isn't about replacing runs of six. This is confusing.\n\nLet me look at Example 1. In Example 1's input line 2: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2], the output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The input has nine 6s starting at position 5. The output replaces them with nine 4s. So that supports the idea that runs of six or more are replaced by 4s of the same length. But then why in Example 0's line 12, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s? That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that in each array, any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced by 4s for the entire length of the run. So if there's a run of 6, 7, etc., all are replaced. So in Example 0's line 3, the six 8s become six 4s, and the seven 2s become seven 4s. In Example 0's line 12, the six 3s become six 4s. But looking at the output provided, the line 12 output is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. Wait, the six 3s in positions 22-27 are replaced with five 4s and a 1. That's inconsistent. Unless there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the output of Example 0's line 12 again:\n\nOriginal input line 12 (Example 0):\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nOutput line 12:\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nWait, in the input, the six 3s are at positions 22-27 (indices 22 to 27). In the output, positions 22-26 are four 4s? Wait, no. Let me count the elements. The output array for line 12 is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nSo after 8,3 (positions 20 and 21), the next elements are 4,4,4,4,4 (positions 22-26), then 1 (position 27). So the six elements in the input (positions 22-27) are replaced with five 4s and a 1. That's not matching the pattern. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the training example, or perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six, but in the case of longer runs, only the first six are replaced. For example, a run of seven would have six 4s and the seventh remains. But in Example 0's line 3 input, the seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. So that's not it. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that runs of six or more are replaced with 4s, but only the first six in the run. For example, if there's a run of seven, replace the first six with 4s and leave the seventh. But in line 3's output, the seven 2s are all replaced with 4s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of six, but the replacement is to replace each group of six. For example, a run of seven would have one group of six replaced with 4s, and the remaining one remains. But in line 3's output, the seven 2s are all replaced with 4s. So that's seven 4s. Which would suggest that any run of six or more is fully replaced, regardless of the length. So why in line 12's output, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s? That's a contradiction.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps I'm missing another aspect of the pattern. Maybe the replacement is done for runs of six, but only if they are followed by a certain number. Or perhaps the replacement is done for the first such run in each array. Let's check other lines in Example 0.\n\nLooking at line 17 in Example 0's input:\n\nInput line 17: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nOutput line 17: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nThe input has seven 1s (positions 10-16: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1). The output replaces them with seven 4s. So that supports the idea that any run of six or more is replaced with 4s. But then why in line 12, the six 3s are replaced with five 4s? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's example, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done only if the run is exactly six, and longer runs are not replaced. But in line 17, the seven 1s are replaced with seven 4s, which contradicts that. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done when the run is six or more, but the replacement is to replace the entire run with 4s. So regardless of the length, all elements in the run become 4s. That seems to fit most cases, except line 12. But line 12's output is conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting line 12's input and output. Let me list the exact indices:\n\nInput line 12 (Example 0):\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:6, 2:2, 3:8, 4:2,5:2,6:2,7:3,8:3,9:8,10:1,11:1,12:3,13:1,14:6,15:1,16:3,17:2,18:8,19:3,20:8,21:3,22:3,23:3,24:3,25:3,26:3,27:1,28:8,29:1.\n\nSo from index 22 to 27: elements 22-27 are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output for line 12 is:\n\nIndices 22:4,23:4,24:4,25:4,26:4,27:1. So the six 3s are replaced with five 4s and a 1. That's impossible unless there's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done for the first occurrence of a run of six or more, and the rest are left as is. But in line 3 of Example 0, both the six 8s and the seven 2s are replaced. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that runs of even length are replaced with 4s. But in line 3's input, six is even and replaced. Line 17's input has seven (odd) replaced. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me think of another approach. Looking at the Test Input. Let's take one of the Test Input lines and see what the expected output would be based on the possible pattern. For example, in the Test Input's third line:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking at this line, there's a run of six 1s starting at position 21 (elements 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1). According to the pattern observed in the training examples, this run of six 1s should be replaced with six 4s. So the output for this line would have 4s in those positions. Let's see if that's what's expected.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is that runs of six or more are replaced with 4s, then this line's output should have six 4s there. \n\nSo, assuming that the pattern is: in each array, replace every consecutive run of six or more identical numbers with the same number of 4s. \n\nThen, applying this to the test input. Let's take the third line of the test input:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nHere, positions 21-26 are six 1s. Replace with six 4s. So the output for this line would have 4,4,4,4,4,4 in those positions.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the fourth line of the test input:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nHere, there's a run of seven 1s starting at position 20 (assuming 0-based index). So replace all seven with 4s. \n\nAnother line in the test input is the fifth line:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nThis line has a run of ten 8s from position 6 to 15. These would all be replaced with 4s. \n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with the same number of 4s. \n\nBut then why in Example 0's line 12, the six 3s were replaced with five 4s and a 1? That's confusing. But maybe the training example has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done only if the run is preceded by a certain condition. For example, perhaps the first occurrence of a run of six or more in the array is replaced. But in line 3 of Example 0, there are two runs replaced, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied only to runs of even numbers. But in Example 0's line 3, the 8s are even and replaced. The 2s are even and replaced. In line 17 of Example 0, the 1s are odd and replaced. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the replacement is done if the run is exactly six, seven, eight, etc., but the number of 4s is six. So regardless of the run length, replace the entire run with six 4s. But in Example 0's line 3, the seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is done for runs of six or more, but the 4s are placed starting at the sixth element. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm. Given the time constraints, perhaps the safest assumption is that the pattern is to replace any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers with the same number of 4s. Despite the conflicting example in line 12 of Example 0, which might be a typo, but given that most other examples fit this pattern, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, applying this pattern to the Test Input:\n\nFor each array in the Test Input, look for consecutive runs of six or more identical numbers and replace each with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's process the Test Input lines one by one:\n\nTest Input line 0: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nCheck for any runs of six or more. Let's see:\n\n3,3,3: three 3s. Then 8,8: two 8s. Then 1,1: two 1s. So no runs of six. So this line remains the same.\n\nTest Input line 1: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck for runs. 6,6 (two), 8,8 (two), 3,3 (two), 8,8 (two), etc. No runs of six. So this line remains the same.\n\nTest Input line 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nHere, positions 21-26: six 1s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nOutput line 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nTest Input line 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nCheck for runs. At positions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nOutput line 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3]\n\nTest Input line 4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nRun of ten 8s (positions 6-15). Replace with ten 4s.\n\nOutput line 4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nWait, but in the input line 4, the run starts at position 6 (assuming 0-based), which is element 8 (since the array is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,...]. So positions 6 to 15 are ten 8s. So replaced with ten 4s.\n\nTest Input line 5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nRun of ten 8s (positions 6-15). Replace with ten 4s. Also, positions 21-25: five 1s (not six), and position 26 is 6. So no other runs. So output line 5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nTest Input line 6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nRun of ten 8s starting at position 6 (8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). Replace with ten 4s. Also, positions 22-27: six 8s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nWait, line 6 input: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nThe first run is eight 8s from positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). So ten 4s. Then, positions 22-27 (after 6,2): eight,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's six 8s. Replace with six 4s. So output line 6 would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,1,1,6,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3]\n\nTest Input line 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nRun of ten 8s starting at position 6. Replace with ten 4s. Also, positions 24-26: three 8s (but they're part of the earlier run). So output line 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. Wait, the input has eleven 8s from positions 6-16: positions 6 to 16 (indices 6-16) are eight,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (eleven 8s). So replaced with eleven 4s. \n\nTest Input line 8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nRun of ten 8s from position 6-15. Replace with ten 4s. Then positions 17-19: three 8s. Not enough.
