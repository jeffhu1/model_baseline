        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, especially the outputs compared to the inputs. \n\nStarting with Example 0: In the input arrays, I notice that some sequences of numbers are replaced with 4s in the output. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0, the input has [8,8,8,8,8,8] and the output replaces those with six 4s. Similarly, in other arrays, sequences of the same number are replaced by 4s. But not all sequences are replaced\u2014some are left as-is.\n\nWait, maybe it's about runs of the same number. Let me check. For example, in the third input array of Example 0: the input starts with [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...]. The output replaces the six 8s with 4s. So the pattern might be that consecutive repeated numbers of a certain length are replaced with 4s. But how many repeats? In this case, six 8s are replaced by six 4s. Let me check another part. \n\nLooking at the first two input arrays in Example 0, their outputs are the same as the inputs. So those arrays don't have any sequences that meet the replacement condition. Let's check when replacement happens. The third array's output has six 4s where the input had six 8s. The fourth array's input has six 8s again, replaced by six 4s. So maybe when there's a run of six or more of the same number, those numbers are replaced by 4s. Wait, but in Example 0's third array, the replacement starts at the fifth element. The input is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...], and the output replaces the six 8s starting at position 4 (0-based index 4) with six 4s. So the condition might be that any run of exactly six consecutive same numbers is replaced by six 4s. But let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1: In the third input array, the input has a run of nine 6s. The output replaces those with 4s. Wait, in Example 1's third input array: the input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,...]. The output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So here, nine 6s are replaced by nine 4s. So maybe any run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s for the entire run. But in Example 0, some runs of six 8s are replaced, and here a longer run is replaced. So the pattern is that any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by the same number of 4s. Let's verify this with other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's first input array, there's a run of three 8s (positions 5-7) which remains 8s in the output. So runs shorter than six are left as-is. Another example: in the 13th input array of Example 0 (the one starting with [8,6,2,8...]), the input has a run of five 3s, which in the output are replaced by five 4s. Wait, wait, no. Let me check. The input is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output has [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. So the run of six 3s starting at index 21 (0-based) is replaced by six 4s. Oh, right, that's exactly six, so they become 4s. So the rule seems to be: replace every consecutive sequence of exactly six identical numbers with six 4s. Wait, but in Example 1's third input array, there's a run of nine 6s, which are all replaced by 4s. So perhaps any run of six or more consecutive same numbers is replaced by 4s for the entire length. So the condition is that if there are six or more consecutive same numbers, replace each of them with 4. Let's confirm.\n\nLooking at another part: Example 0's input array 2: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]. The output is [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]. So here, the first run is six 8s (positions 4-9) which become six 4s. Then there's a run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) which becomes seven 4s. So that's a run longer than six, and they are all replaced. So the rule is: replace any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers with the same number of 4s. That seems to fit.\n\nNow, looking at Example 1's input arrays, the same pattern applies. For example, the third input array in Example 1 has a run of nine 6s, replaced by nine 4s. The second input array in Example 1's output shows runs of 6s longer than six being replaced by 4s. \n\nSo the pattern is: in each array, scan for consecutive runs of the same number. If the run length is six or more, replace each element in that run with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the Test Input. Let's take each array in the test input and check for runs of six or more same numbers, replacing them with 4s.\n\nLet's look at the Test Input arrays:\n\nFirst test array:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nLooking for runs of 6+ same numbers. The elements here are 6,8,3,3,3,8, etc. The runs are short. The longest run here is three 3s (positions 2-4). No replacements needed here. So the output array remains the same as input.\n\nSecond test array:\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\nAgain, no runs of six. So output same as input.\n\nThird test array:\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\nLooking at this array, positions 21-26 (0-based index 21 is the 22nd element) are six 1s. So this run of six 1s should be replaced by six 4s. The rest remain. So the output for this array would be the same except the six 1s become 4s.\n\nFourth test array:\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\nHere, the run of seven 1s (positions 20-26) is replaced by seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array:\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\nLooking for runs. The 8s from position 6 to 15: starting at index 6 (element 7th), the sequence is eight 8s followed by a 6. Wait, the input is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,...]. Wait, position 6 (element 7) is 8, followed by eight 8s (positions 6 to 14, inclusive). That's a run of nine 8s. So these nine 8s should be replaced by nine 4s. Then later, there's a run of seven 1s (positions 20-26). Wait, the array continues as 1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8. The positions for the 1s are indices 19 (value 1), then 20-26 (seven 1s). So that's eight 1s (from index 19 to 26?), wait let me count:\n\nLooking at the fifth test array as written:\n\nOriginal array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nSo positions 6-15 (indices 6 to 15, inclusive) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Wait, index 6 is the 7th element. Let me count the elements:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:1, 2:2,3:3,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1, etc. So from index6 (element 6) to index15 (element15) there are 10 elements, all 8s. That's a run of 10 8s. So these 10 8s would be replaced by 10 4s. Then later, at index19 (element 20?), there's 1, followed by seven 1s (indices 19 to 25 inclusive). That's a run of seven 1s, replaced by seven 4s. Then the 8 at index26. So the fifth array's output would have those runs replaced.\n\nContinuing with the test arrays:\n\nSixth test array: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\nLooking at runs: the 8s from position 6 to 15 (indices 6-15), which is ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then in positions 21-25 (five 1s), which is less than six, so no replacement. The 6 at position26 (element 27) is single. So output this array with the 8s replaced by 4s.\n\nSeventh test array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\nThe 8s from index6 to 15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at the end, eight 8s (indices 22-29?), but wait the array is [3,3,3,3,8,3, ...]. Let me check: after the initial elements, index4 is 8, index5 is 3. Then index6 is 8, followed by 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (indices6-15), which is ten 8s. Then from index22 onwards: elements 22-27 (assuming the array is length 30) are eight 8s? Wait the original array is:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nSo after the 16th element (index15 is 8), then 1,3,1,1,6,2. Then from index22 (element23) onwards: 8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3. That's six 8s (index22-27). So that's a run of six 8s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nSo this array would have two replaced runs: ten 8s replaced by ten 4s, and six 8s replaced by six 4s.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again:\n\nIn the seventh test array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nBreaking down:\n\nElements 0-3: four 3s. Then 8,3 (elements4 and5). Then elements6-15: ten 8s. Then elements16-19: 1,3,1,1. Then 6,2 (elements20-21). Then elements22-27: six 8s. Then 1,3 (elements28-29). So the ten 8s (elements6-15) are replaced by ten 4s. The six 8s (elements22-27) are replaced by six 4s. The rest remain.\n\nSo in the output, those two runs become 4s.\n\nEighth test array: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\nLooking for runs. The 8s start at index6 (element7) and go to index15 (element16). That's 10 8s (elements6-15), then another 8 at index16 (element17). So a run of 11 8s (elements6-16). So replace all 11 with 4s.\n\nNinth test array: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\nThe run of eight 8s from index6 to index15 (elements7-16?), let me check:\n\nOriginal array: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nElements6-15 (indices6-15) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements). So ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Then there's a run of three 8s (elements17-19), which is less than six, so not replaced.\n\nTenth test array: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\nThe run of eight 8s from index6 to index15 (elements7-16?), let's see:\n\nOriginal array: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nElements6-15 are eight 8s (indices6-15: elements7 to 16?), wait perhaps I need to recheck. The array is:\n\nIndices:\n\n0:8,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:1,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:3, etc. So from index6 (element7) to index15 (element16), there are 10 8s (elements6-15 inclusive is 10 elements). So that's ten 8s, replaced by ten 4s.\n\nEleventh test array: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\nThe run of 8s from index5 (element6) to index14 (element15) is ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, there's a run of three 1s at the end (elements26-28), which is not replaced.\n\nTwelfth test array: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\nNo runs of six or more. So output same as input.\n\nThirteenth test array: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\nLooking for runs. The sequence [8,8] (elements6-7) is two 8s. Then [2,2,2,2] (elements11-14) is four 2s. No runs of six. So output same.\n\nFourteenth test array: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]\nNo runs of six. Output same.\n\nFifteenth test array: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]\nCheck for runs. The 8s at the end: elements18-20 (8,8,8) three 8s. No runs of six. Output same.\n\nSixteenth test array: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\nCheck for runs. The elements18-20:3,3,3. Then elements21-23:3,3,3. So consecutive 3s from 18-23 (six 3s). So this is a run of six 3s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nWait, let me look at the array:\n\n[6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\n\nLooking for consecutive numbers. At positions 16-18:3,3,3. Then after a 6 (position19), then three 3s (positions20-22). So not consecutive. So no run of six. So no replacement here. So this array has no runs of six or more. So output same.\n\nSeventeenth test array: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]\nLooking for runs. The 8s at positions22-24 (elements23-25?) which is three 8s. No runs of six. Output same.\n\nEighteenth test array: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]\nCheck for runs. The 3s at position7-8 (3,3). No runs. Output same.\n\nNineteenth test array: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]\nNo runs of six. Output same.\n\nTwentieth test array: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\nCheck for runs. The 3s from position13-18:3,3,3,3,6,3. Wait, position13 is 3, then 3,3,3,6,3. So the run of four 3s, then a 6, then a 3. Not a consecutive run. Then positions16-20:3,3,3,3,3 (five 3s). So not six. So no replacement. The 8s at the start are three 8s. So output same.\n\nTwenty-first test array: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\nLooking for runs. The 3s from positions13-18:3,3,1,3,3,3. Not consecutive. Then positions15-20:3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). So indices15-20 (assuming 0-based), which is elements16-21. Wait the array is [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1].\n\nElements13-20: elements14 (3), 15 (3), 16 (1), 17 (3), 18 (3), 19 (3), 20 (3), 21 (3). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recount:\n\nElements:\n\n0:6,1:8,2:3,3:8,4:1,5:2,6:8,7:3,8:8,9:3,10:1,11:8,12:3,13:3,14:1,15:3,16:3,17:3,18:3,19:3,20:3,21:8,...\n\nLooking for a run of six 3s. From element15 to element20: 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six 3s. So indices15-20. So replace these six with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second test array: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\nCheck for runs. The 3s from positions15-21:3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test array: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\nCheck for runs. The 3s from positions16-21: six 3s. Replace with six 4s. Then at positions22-23:8,8. Not enough.\n\nTwenty-fourth test array: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\nThe 3s from positions16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test array: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\nThe 3s from positions16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s. Then 8,3, etc. So that's a run of seven 3s.\n\nTwenty-sixth test array: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\nCheck for runs. The 3s from positions13-20: eight 3s. Replace with eight 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test array: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\nCheck for runs. The 3s from positions9-14 (elements10-15):3,3,3,3,3,3. Six 3s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-eighth test array: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\nCheck for runs. The 8s from positions8-11: four 8s. Not enough. Output same.\n\nTwenty-ninth test array: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\nCheck for runs. The 3s from positions6-9: four 3s. Not enough. Output same.\n\nThirtieth test array: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\nNo runs of six or more. Output same.\n\nSo applying this pattern to each array in the test input. Each run of six or more same numbers is replaced by the same number of 4s. All other elements remain the same."
