        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially the first one. The input and output lists are mostly the same, but some parts are replaced with 4s. For instance, in Example 0, the third input list starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, ...], and the output is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,...]. So the consecutive 8s after the 1 are replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, but how many consecutive numbers are being replaced? Let's check. The original sequence is six 8s, and they become six 4s. Similarly, in another part of the same example, there are seven 2s in the input that become seven 4s in the output. So maybe any consecutive run of the same number longer than a certain length is replaced with 4s. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's input, there are sequences like eight 8s in the fourth list, which become eight 4s in the output. So the replacement seems to be replacing runs of 6 or more of the same number with 4s. Let's verify with another example. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input list has a run of nine 6s, which in the output becomes nine 4s. Another part of the input in Example 1 has a run of seven 8s, which becomes seven 4s. So the pattern is that whenever there are 6 or more consecutive same numbers, they are replaced by 4s of the same length. \n\nBut wait, some examples have runs of 6 exactly replaced. Let me check the first example again. In Example 0's third input array, the sixth element starts with eight 8s (positions 4 to 9), which in output are replaced by six 4s. Wait, no. Wait, the input is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,...], which is six 8s starting at position 4. The output is replaced with 4s for those six. So maybe exactly 6 or more consecutive elements are replaced. So any run of exactly 6 or more same numbers becomes 4s. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's third input array, the input has a run of nine 6s (positions 5 to 13?), but in the output, it's replaced with nine 4s. So regardless of the length, as long as it's 6 or more, replace all with 4s. So the rule is: for any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 6 or longer, replace each element in that sequence with 4. \n\nBut wait, looking at the first training example's first input list. The input has [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...], and the output is the same. So those three 8s are not replaced. So the threshold is 6. Only runs of 6 or more are replaced. \n\nLet me confirm with the test input. For example, in the test input's fifth array: [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,...]. The run of 8s here is 10 in a row. So according to the pattern, those would become 4s. Let's see if that's the case in the output. But since I need to generate the output, I need to apply this rule to all the test input arrays.\n\nSo the process is: for each array in the input, scan through and find consecutive runs of the same number. If a run is 6 or longer, replace all elements in that run with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nLet me check another part. For instance, in Example 0's input, the array [3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 1,3,3,1,8,3,1,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,1,1,2,1,8] has a run of two 8s at the end (positions 26 and 27?), but in the output, those are unchanged. So runs shorter than 6 are left as is. \n\nSo the conclusion is: the transformation is replacing every consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the third test input array: [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. The part from index 20 to 26 (assuming 0-based) is seven 1s. So those seven 1s should become seven 4s.\n\nAnother example in the test input is the fourth array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The run of 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) would become 4s. Similarly, the run of seven 1s later would also be replaced.\n\nSo for each array in the test input, I need to process each element, check consecutive runs, replace runs of 6+ with 4s, and leave others as is.\n\nSo the final answer will be the test input arrays with the appropriate runs replaced by 4s."
