        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is about transforming an input list of numbers into an output list by following some hidden rule. The training examples show how the input is modified to get the output, and I need to apply the same pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input and output lists are quite long. Let me compare them. For instance, in Example 0, the third input array starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...], and the output changes the middle part of the 8s to 4s. Specifically, positions 4 to 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based index?) in the input are all 8s, and in the output, they become 4s. Let me check another part. The fourth input array in Example 0 has [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...], and the output changes those six 8s to 4s. Wait, but the output shows [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,...], so from index 4 to 9, the 8s are replaced with 4s. Similarly, in the second example (Example 1), the third input array has a sequence of 6s starting at position 5, and the output replaces them with 4s. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be replacing a consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number with 4s. Let me verify this. Let's take another example. In Example 0, the first input array doesn't have any such sequence, so the output remains the same. The second input array also doesn't have a run of six same numbers, so output is same. The third input array has six 8s starting at position 4 (if we count starting from 0, positions 4-9 would be six elements). Those are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, the fourth input array has six 8s in positions 4-9, replaced by 4s. \n\nWait, but looking at Example 0's third input line: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...], the sixth to ninth elements (indices 4-9) are eight 8s? Wait, let's count: positions 0:1,1:8,2:3,3:1, then positions 4-9 (elements 5th to 10th) are 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). So in the output, those six 8s are replaced with six 4s. So the rule might be: whenever there's a consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number, replace each of those numbers with 4. But wait, in Example 0's third input array, the output changes those six 8s to 4s. Similarly, in other examples where there are six consecutive same numbers, they are replaced by 4s. Let me check other parts. \n\nLooking at Example 0's 12th input array: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output here has [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. The consecutive six 3s starting at position 22 (if 0-based) are replaced with 4s. So yes, that's a sequence of six 3s turned into 4s. \n\nAnother example in Example 0's 17th input array: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]. The output here changes the sequence of seven 1s (positions 10-16) to 4s. Wait, in the output it's [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]. So the seven 1s become seven 4s. So the rule is: any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire run. \n\nBut wait, in the 17th input array, the original 1s are seven in a row, and they are all replaced by 4s. So the exact number of replacements depends on the length of the consecutive sequence. If the sequence is exactly six, they become six 4s. If longer, like seven, they become seven 4s. \n\nSo the transformation is to scan the input list, and for every consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers, replace each element in that sequence with 4. All other elements remain the same. \n\nLet me check another example. In Example 1's third input array: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The output here is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The original has nine 6s in a row (positions 5-13), which are replaced with 4s. \n\nSo the pattern seems consistent. Now, applying this to the test input. Let's look at the test input arrays. For each array, I need to check for consecutive sequences of six or more same numbers and replace them with 4s. Let's take the first test input array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for any sequences of 6 or more same numbers. Let's go through each element:\n\n6,8,3,3,3,8: no. Then 1,8,3,8,8,1: no. Then 6,3,1,2,3,1: no. 1,1,1,3,1: only three 1s. Then 2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6: no. So this array has no sequences of six same numbers. So the output would be the same as input.\n\nSecond test input array:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck for runs. Let's see:\n\n1,6,6,8,8,1: no. Then 3,3,6,3,8,8: two 3s, then others. Then 2,1,1,3,6,8: no. 8,3,1,2,1,8: no. 2,3,8,8,8,2: three 8s. So again, no runs of six. So output same.\n\nThird test input array:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence starting at position 20 (assuming 0-based index): elements 20-25 are [1,1,1,1,1,1]. That's six 1s. So this would be replaced by six 4s. So the output for this array would have those six 1s replaced with 4s.\n\nFourth test input array:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nCheck for runs. At position 20-26: seven 1s. So replace those seven with 4s.\n\nFifth test input array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s from position 6 to 15: that's 10 consecutive 8s. Replace all with 4s.\n\nSixth test input array:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nThe 8s from position 6 to 15: that's 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Also, the 1s from position 20-24: five 1s, not enough. Then position 25: another 1, making six 1s (positions 20-25: six 1s). So replace those six 1s with 4s.\n\nWait, let's count again. Positions are 0-based. The sixth array:\n\nIndices 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements). All 8s. Replace with 4s. Then at positions 20-25: elements 20 is 1, 21 is 1, 22 is 1, 23 is 1, 24 is 1, 25 is 1. Six 1s. So replace those with 4s. Then the rest remains.\n\nSeventh test input array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nCheck for runs. The 8s starting at position 6 (element 6) to 15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then the 8s at 22-27: six 8s. Replace those as well.\n\nEighth test input array:\n\n[3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nThe 8s from position 6 to 15: ten 8s. Then another 8 at position 16, making it 11 consecutive 8s. All are replaced with 4s. So the entire sequence from 6 to 16 (eleven 8s) becomes 4s.\n\nContinuing this way for each array in the test input. The key is to find any consecutive sequences of six or more same numbers and replace each element in those sequences with 4. All other elements stay the same.\n\nNow, I need to process each of the test input arrays, check for such sequences, and replace them accordingly. Let's go through each test input array one by one and apply the transformation.\n\nFor brevity, I'll outline the approach for each array and then provide the transformed output."
