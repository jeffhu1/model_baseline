        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and Example 1, the inputs are lists of numbers, and the outputs have some numbers replaced with 4s. Let me compare the input and output of the first example to see where those 4s come in.\n\nIn Example 0, the input starts with a list, and the output has some sequences replaced with 4. Let's take the third array in Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nWait, the input has a run of six 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9), and the output replaces them with six 4s. Then later, there's a run of seven 2s starting at position 20 (indices 20-26), which are replaced by seven 4s. But looking at other arrays in the example, maybe it's about consecutive identical numbers. Let's check another array in Example 0.\n\nTake the fourth input array:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s from position 4-9, replaced by six 4s. Then seven 2s starting at position 20-26 (but output has seven 4s, but in the output it's replaced up to the seventh position, making seven 4s. Wait, in the output, positions 20-26 (assuming 0-based) would be seven elements. So maybe the rule is that consecutive numbers with a run of 5 or more are replaced by 4s?\n\nWait, in the third input array of Example 0, the 8s are six in a row. So maybe sequences of 5 or more identical numbers are replaced with 4s. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third input array:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the input has nine 6s starting at position 5 (indices 5-13), which are replaced by nine 4s. So that's a run longer than 5. So the pattern seems to be that any consecutive sequence of the same number with a length of 5 or more is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the first array in input:\n\nInput: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]\n\nOutput is the same as input. So why wasn't the three 8s replaced? Because the length is 3, which is less than 5. Similarly, the next array in Example 0's input has [8,2,1,6,3,1,8,3,1,8,3,8,8,1,3,2,8,3,8,8,3,1,3,1,8,3,2,6,2,6]. The output has the same numbers except in positions where there's a run of 5 or more? Let me check. In that array, the input has two 8s at positions 6 and 7? No, in that array, looking for runs. Let's see the input array:\n\n[8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]\n\nLooking for consecutive repeats. At positions 11 and 12: two 8s. Then at positions 18 and 19: two 8s. No runs of 5, so the output is the same as input. So the rule is that any consecutive run of 5 or more same numbers is replaced by 4s of that length.\n\nSo the transformation is: in each array, replace every consecutive sequence of 5 or more identical numbers with the same number of 4s.\n\nNow, let's check the test input. The test input has several arrays, and we need to apply this pattern.\n\nLooking at the third array in the test input:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, the sequence from positions 21 to 26 (0-based) is six 1s. So this should be replaced by six 4s.\n\nAnother test input array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, from position 20 to 26, there's a run of seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in the fifth test input array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe input has a long run of 8s starting at position 4 (assuming 0-based). Let's count: positions 4 to 15 (since it's 8,6, followed by eight 8s). Wait, the input is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1...]. Wait, position 4 is 8, then position 5 is 6? So the 8s start at position 6. Let's check: from position 6 (8) to 15: positions 6-15 are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 8s. So replace with 10 4s.\n\nSo in each array of the test input, I need to find all consecutive sequences of 5 or more same numbers and replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nLet me apply this to each test input array.\n\nFirst array of test input:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 5. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6,8,3,3,3 (three 3s: not enough)\n- 8,1,8,3,8,8 (two 8s)\n- 1,1,1 (three 1s)\n- So no runs of 5, so output is same as input.\n\nSecond array:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs. The only possible run is the three 8s at the end (positions 26-28). Not enough. So output same as input.\n\nThird array:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nAt positions 21-26: six 1s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nFourth array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nPositions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nCheck for runs. From position 6 (8,6) then 8s start at position 6: Wait, let's index correctly. The array is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,...]. So positions 6 to 15 (0-based) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 8s. Replace with 10 4s.\n\nSixth array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nSame as fifth array, the 8s from position 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Also, positions 22-26: five 1s. Replace with five 4s.\n\nWait, the array is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nSo positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then positions 22-26 (assuming 0-based): let's see. After 1,6, then 1s start at position 22: 1,1,1,1,1 (positions 22-26? Let's count:\n\nIndices 0:6, 1:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:8, 16:1, 17:1, 18:3, 19:1, 20:6, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:6, ... So positions 21-25: 1,1,1,1,1 (five 1s). So replace with five 4s.\n\nSo the sixth array's output would have two replaced sequences: ten 4s and five 4s.\n\nSimilarly, process each array in the test input. Let's do another example.\n\nSeventh array in test input:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The first four 3s (positions 0-3): four, not enough. Then 8,3, then starting at position 4: 8, followed by 3? Wait the array is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. So the 8s start at position 6 (8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8): positions 6-15. Ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s. Then positions 23-28: 8,8,8,8,8,8. Six 8s \u2192 six 4s. So two replacements.\n\nWait the array has:\n\nPositions 6-15: 8s (10 elements) \u2192 replaced by 4s.\n\nPositions 23-28: 8s. Let's check the indices. The array after position 16 is 1,3,1,1,6,2, then positions 22:8, 23:8, 24:8, 25:8, 26:8, 27:8. So six 8s (positions 22-27). So replace with six 4s.\n\nSo in the seventh array, two runs are replaced: 10 4s and six 4s.\n\nAnother example, the eighth array in test input:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. From position 6 (8s) to position 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-16). Wait, the array is [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. So positions 6-16: 8s. That's 11 elements. So replace with 11 4s.\n\nThen positions 25-27: three 8s (not enough).\n\nSo only the first run is replaced.\n\nNow, putting all together. For each array in the test input, we need to replace any consecutive runs of 5 or more same numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo, the final step is to process each test input array, identify those runs, and replace them with 4s. The rest of the numbers remain the same."
