        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples, then apply that pattern to the test input. Let's look at the examples provided to see if I can spot the pattern.\n\nStarting with Example 0. The input is a bunch of lists, and the output modifies some parts of them. Let me compare a few input and output pairs.\n\nLooking at the third input list in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, I notice that sequences of 8s and 2s in the input are being replaced with 4s. For instance, the input has 8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 4-9) which become four 4s? Wait, wait, no\u2014wait, that's six elements. Wait, in the input it's six 8s, and in the output they are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, the 2s at positions 20-26 (seven 2s) become seven 4s. So maybe whenever there's a consecutive run of the same number (like 8 or 2 here), if the length is 6 or more, they are replaced with 4s? Or maybe there's a different condition.\n\nLooking at another example. Let's take the fourth input list in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the sequence of six 8s becomes six 4s. The seven 2s become seven 4s. Wait, but in the output, the last element of the 2s run is replaced with a 2. Wait, let me check. The input has positions 20-27 (8 elements) of 2s. The output is 20-26: seven 4s, then a 2. Wait, but that's eight elements. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see the input part for the 2s: the input list's positions 20-27 (assuming zero-based or one-based?) Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for the fourth list in Example 0:\nInput list after the 8,3 is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. So eight 2s. The output is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. Wait, that's seven 4s followed by a 2. Hmm. So the first seven 2s are replaced with 4s, and the eighth remains as 2? That seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm missing the pattern here.\n\nWait, looking back at the third example's output. The input had six 8s replaced by six 4s. Then the 2s in positions 20-26 (seven elements) in the input become seven 4s. So perhaps the rule is that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire run. But in the fourth example, the run of eight 2s becomes seven 4s and a 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the runs of exactly six elements are replaced with 4s, but longer runs are partially replaced? Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at the seventh input in Example 0's input:\nInput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6]\nOutput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8, 6]\n\nHere, the input has seven 8s (positions 4-10), but the output replaces the first six with 4s, and leaves the seventh as 8. Then the run of eight 2s (positions 20-27) becomes seven 4s and one 2. So maybe the rule is that any run of exactly six elements becomes 4s. If the run is longer than six, the first six are replaced with 4s, and the remaining stay as the original number. Let's check.\n\nIn the third example's input, the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Then the seven 2s in positions 20-26 (assuming 20 is the first 2) would be replaced with seven 4s. Wait, but in the output of the fourth example, the run of eight 2s becomes seven 4s and one 2. Wait, maybe the sixth element in the run is replaced, but the rest remain? Or perhaps only runs of exactly six are replaced, and longer runs are not? But that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but only the first six elements in the run are replaced with 4s, and the rest remain as they are. Let's test that.\n\nTake the fourth input list again. The run of eight 8s (positions 4-11) becomes six 4s followed by two 8s? Wait, the output shows positions 4-9 as 4,4,4,4,4,4. Then the next element in input is 8 (position 10) which in output is 8. So that's six 4s followed by the original elements beyond the sixth. Similarly, the run of eight 2s in positions 20-27: output has seven 4s followed by a 2. Wait, that's seven 4s. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count again.\n\nOriginal input (fourth example) for the 8s run: positions 4-9 are six 8s. Then position 10 is 3. So the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Then the run of eight 2s: positions 20-27 are eight 2s. In the output, positions 20-26 are seven 4s, then position 27 is 2. So the first seven 2s are replaced with 4s, but that's not six. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm, perhaps the pattern isn't just about replacing runs of six or more with 4s. Let me look for another angle.\n\nWait, in the output examples, sometimes 4 appears. Let's check where else 4s show up. For example, in the third example's output, the 8s in positions 4-9 (six elements) become 4s. Similarly, the 2s in positions 20-26 (seven elements) become 4s. So maybe any run of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s. But in the fourth example, the run of eight 8s becomes six 4s (positions 4-9) and the next two 8s are replaced with 4s? Wait, no, in the fourth example's input, the 8s are positions 4-9 (six 8s), but in the output, they are replaced with six 4s. Then the next elements are 3,8, etc. So that's correct. But the 2s run is eight elements, but in the output, they become seven 4s and a 2. Wait, that's seven 4s. So maybe that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for the entire run if it's six or more. But in the fourth example's 2s run (eight elements), the output replaces all eight with 4s. Wait, but in the output, the last element is 2. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for the fourth example's 2s run: positions 20-27 (assuming 0-based or 1-based index? The problem lists the elements as they are, so maybe 0-based. Let's see:\n\nInput: ... 8,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,3. So starting from the 20th element (if the first element is 0), that's eight 2s. The output is ...8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3. So positions 20-26 are seven 4s, position 27 is 2. Wait, that's eight elements. So the first seven are 4s and the last remains 2. That's not matching. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s replace runs of exactly six elements, and if the run is longer, only six are replaced. Let's check another example. Let's look at the fifth input list in Example 0:\n\nInput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]\nOutput: [3, 3, 8, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 6, 2]\n\nThe input has six 8s (positions 4-9) which become six 4s. Then the run of eight 2s (positions 20-27) becomes seven 4s followed by a 3? Wait, in the output, positions 20-26 are seven 4s, and position 27 is 3. But the original input's 2s run ends at position 27. So the output here has seven 4s for a run of eight 2s. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace runs of six or more of the same number with 4s, but only if the run starts after the first element. Or perhaps it's looking for sequences of six or more of the same number, and replaces them with 4s, but the replacement is only for the first six elements. Wait, let's see:\n\nIn the fifth example's input, the 8s are six in a row. They are replaced with six 4s. The 2s are eight in a row. The output replaces the first seven with 4s. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nLooking at Example 1's inputs and outputs. Let's take the third input list:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nWait, here the input has a run of nine 6s starting at position 5. The output replaces them with nine 4s. So that's a run longer than six, and all are replaced. So that contradicts the previous idea where only the first six were replaced. So that suggests that in Example 1, runs of six or more are all replaced with 4s. But in Example 0, the run of eight 2s was replaced with seven 4s and a 2. Hmm, this is inconsistent. So perhaps the rule isn't simply replacing runs of six or more with 4s.\n\nWait, but maybe the examples are using a different replacement number. Looking back at the first example's output, the replacement is with 4s. But in the first training example (Example 0), the third input's output has 4s. In Example 1's third input's output, the 6s are replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement number depends on the value in the run. For instance, in Example 0, the 8s and 2s are replaced with 4. In Example 1, the 6s are replaced with 4. So maybe the rule is: any run of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4, regardless of the original number. That would explain why in Example 0, both 8s and 2s are replaced with 4s, and in Example 1, 6s are replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the pattern is: in any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers, replace all elements of that run with 4s.\n\nBut let's check. Take the third input in Example 0's output. The 8s (six in a row) are replaced with six 4s. The seven 2s are replaced with seven 4s. So yes, that fits. But in the fourth input list's output, the eight 2s are replaced with eight 4s. Wait, no, in the fourth input list's output, the 2s run becomes seven 4s and a 2. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nFourth input list in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe input has eight 8s (positions 4-11?) Wait, positions 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) followed by a 3. So in the output, these six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Then, the next run is eight 2s (positions 20-27). The output replaces the first seven 2s with 4s and the last remains as 2. Wait, but according to the rule, any run of six or more should be replaced. So why is one 2 left?\n\nAh, perhaps there's a mistake in my observation. Let me recount the elements. Let's list the input and output:\n\nInput's 2s run: positions 20-27 (elements 20 to 27, inclusive) in the input are eight 2s. The output for these positions is seven 4s followed by a 2. So the output has seven 4s and one 2, which totals eight elements. So why is the last one not replaced? This contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, maybe the run must be exactly six. Let's see. If the run is exactly six, replace with 4s. If longer, leave the rest as original. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third input list, the 8s run is exactly six elements, replaced with six 4s. The 2s run is seven elements, replaced with seven 4s. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe runs of six or more are replaced with 4s, but only the first six elements, and the rest remain. Let's check the fourth example.\n\nInput's 8s run is six elements: replaced with six 4s. The 2s run is eight elements. According to the rule, replace the first six with 4s, leave the remaining two. But in the output, the 2s run becomes seven 4s and one 2. So that's seven replaced. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for the entire run if it's six or longer. But in the fourth example, the 2s run is eight elements, which should all be replaced. But in the output, only seven are. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is to replace every run of exactly six elements with 4s. If the run is longer than six, it's not replaced. But that doesn't explain the third example, where the 2s run is seven elements and are replaced with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but the replacement is for the entire run. But how to explain the fourth example's output?\n\nLet me check other examples. Let's look at Example 0's seventh input:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6]\n\nOutput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8, 6]\n\nHere, the 8s run is seven elements (positions 4-10). The output replaces the first six with 4s, and the seventh remains 8. The 2s run is eight elements. The output replaces the first seven with 4s, leaving the last as 2. So this suggests that when a run is longer than six, only the first six are replaced, and the rest remain. Wait, but in the first six 8s (positions 4-9), the seventh is position 10. So in the input, positions 4-10 are seven 8s. The output has positions 4-9 as 4s (six), and position 10 as 8. Then the 2s run is eight elements: positions 20-27. Output has seven 4s (positions 20-26) and position 27 as 2. So this suggests that runs longer than six are replaced as follows: replace the first six elements with 4s and leave the rest as they are.\n\nBut in the fourth example, the 2s run is eight elements. So positions 20-27. Replace first six as 4s, and leave positions 26-27 as 2s. Wait, but in the output, it's seven 4s and one 2. How does that fit?\n\nLet's count:\n\nOriginal 8 2s: positions 20-27 (0-based):\n\nInput: 20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2.\n\nOutput: 20:4, 21:4, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:2.\n\nSo the first seven elements (positions 20-26) are replaced with 4s, and position 27 remains 2. But according to the previous idea, only the first six should be replaced. So this is inconsistent.\n\nHmm. This is getting confusing. Maybe there's another pattern here. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nAnother approach: in the output lists, the number 4 appears only in certain positions. Let's check where else 4 appears. For example, in Example 0's first output, there are no 4s. In the third output list, 4s appear in positions 4-9 and 20-26. The same in other examples. So maybe the 4s are replacing consecutive sequences of 8s or 2s, but that doesn't hold when looking at other examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1's third input, the run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. So it's not about the original number. So the replacement is always with 4, regardless of the original number. So the pattern is: any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire run.\n\nBut then why in the fourth example's 2s run, the output has seven 4s and one 2? Unless I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, maybe the 4s are replacing runs of exactly six elements, and if the run is longer than six, it's split into chunks of six. For example, a run of eight would be six replaced, and the remaining two remain. But the example in fourth input's 2s run is eight elements, but seven are replaced. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a run of seven elements: if the run is exactly six, replace. If it's seven, replace all seven. But in Example 0's third input's 2s run (seven elements), they are replaced with seven 4s. So perhaps any run of six or more elements is replaced entirely with 4s. Then why in the fourth example's output, there's a 2 left?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the lists. Let me re-express the fourth example's input and output:\n\nInput fourth list in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nSo the input's 8s run is six elements (positions 4-9: 8,8,8,8,8,8). They are replaced with six 4s. Then the 2s run starts at position 20 and is eight elements: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2. The output for this run is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. That's eight elements. So why is the last one a 2? That doesn't fit the idea that runs of six or more are entirely replaced. Unless there's another rule here.\n\nWait, perhaps the runs of six or more elements are replaced with 4s, but the replacement starts from the first occurrence and continues until the end of the run. But in the fourth example, the run is eight elements. So all should be 4s. But in the output, the last one is a 2. So perhaps there's an exception. Or perhaps the run is split into two parts: maybe there's another number interrupting the run? Let me check the input again.\n\nNo, the input has eight consecutive 2s. So that's a single run. The output has seven 4s followed by a 2. So this suggests that the pattern isn't simply replacing all elements in runs of six or more.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me look for another pattern. Maybe the 4s are replacing runs of six or more, but the replacement depends on the position in the list. For example, maybe every seventh element in a run is left as is. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all runs of six or more elements with 4s, but only if the run starts after the first element. But that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, looking at Example 0's seventh input:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6]\n\nOutput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8, 6]\n\nThe input's 8s run is seven elements long (positions 4-10). The output replaces the first six with 4s and leaves the seventh as 8. The 2s run is eight elements (positions 20-27). The output replaces the first seven with 4s and leaves the eighth as 2. So the pattern here seems to be that for runs longer than six, the first six are replaced with 4s, and the rest remain. But in the 8s run, the seventh element (position 10) is left as 8. So that fits: six replaced, one left. But in the 2s run, eight elements become seven 4s and one 2. So that's six plus one replaced? Or seven replaced.\n\nHmm, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but the number of replacements is the run length minus one. For example, a run of six: replace all six. A run of seven: replace six and leave one. A run of eight: replace seven and leave one. But this doesn't seem to fit with previous examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first six elements of any run of six or more are replaced with 4s, and the rest remain. So for a run of seven: six replaced, one remains. Run of eight: six replaced, two remain. But in the fourth example's 2s run of eight, the output has seven 4s and one 2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the replacement starts from the second element of the run. For example, if a run is six or more, starting from the second element, replace with 4s. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the sixth occurrence of a number in a run is replaced with 4, and any subsequent elements are replaced as well. So if there's a run of six, all six are 4. If seven, all seven are 4. But that doesn't explain the fourth example.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is that whenever there is a sequence of six or more of the same number, the entire sequence is replaced with 4s. But some examples contradict this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace the sixth element with 4, and leave the rest as is. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern involves the sum of the numbers. But looking at the input and output lists, the sums may vary. For example, in the third input of Example 0, the input has six 8s replaced with six 4s, reducing the sum by 6*(8-4)=24. The 2s run of seven is replaced with 4s, reducing by 7*(2-4) = -14. So the sum would decrease by 24 and increase by 14, but this seems arbitrary and not a clear pattern.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's look for other patterns. For example, maybe the output is the same as the input except for certain positions where a run of six or more begins. For example, the first six elements of any run of six or more are replaced with 4s, and the rest are left as is.\n\nIn the fourth example's 2s run of eight elements, replacing the first six with 4s would result in six 4s followed by two 2s. But the output has seven 4s and one 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement starts after the first element. For example, the first element of the run is kept, and the next five are replaced with 4s. But in Example 0's third input's 8s run: input is six 8s. Output is six 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look at more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third input:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nThe input has a run of nine 6s starting at position 5. The output replaces all nine with 4s. So this supports the idea that any run of six or more is replaced entirely with 4s. But why in the fourth example of Example 0, the run of eight 2s is replaced with seven 4s and one 2?\n\nAh, maybe there's a mistake in how I'm counting the elements. Let me recount the fourth example's 2s run.\n\nInput fourth example of Example 0:\n\nThe 2s run starts at position 20 (if zero-based) in the list. Let me list the elements from 20 onwards:\n\nInput: positions 20-27: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 \u2192 eight elements.\n\nOutput: positions 20-27: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2.\n\nSo seven 4s and one 2. This is eight elements. So why isn't the entire run replaced? This is conflicting with the previous examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is different. Maybe the replacement is done for runs of six or more of the same number, but only if the run is in certain positions. For example, starting at certain indices. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied only to the first run of six or more in the list, and subsequent runs are left as-is. But in the fourth example, there are two runs of six or more (the 8s and the 2s), and both are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really puzzling. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the test input and see if applying the suspected pattern would help.\n\nLooking at the test input's fifth line:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nHere, there's a run of ten 8s (positions 6-15). If the rule is to replace all 8s in runs of six or more with 4s, then this entire run would become 4s. But in the training examples, sometimes runs longer than six are replaced entirely (like Example 1's third input), but sometimes not (like Example 0's fourth input). This inconsistency makes it hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace every occurrence of a number after the fifth in a run with 4. So for example, in a run of eight 8s, the first five remain 8, and the next three become 4. Let's check if that fits any example.\n\nIn Example 0's third input's 8s run of six: first five 8s remain, sixth becomes 4. But the output is six 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after six elements, the rest are replaced. So for a run of eight, elements six to eight are replaced. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is to replace the entire run with 4s if the run's length is even, or something like that. But I don't see a pattern there.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's fourth input and output:\n\nInput 2s run: 8 elements. Output: seven 4s and one 2. 8-7=1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts after the first element of the run. So for a run of six, elements 2-6 are replaced with 4s, leaving the first element. But in Example 0's third input's 8s run, all six are replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 4s equals the number of elements in the run minus one. For example, a run of six: five 4s. But in Example 0's third input, it's six 4s. So that's not.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to see if there's any other pattern that I'm missing. For example, maybe the sum of certain elements, but that's unlikely given the examples. Or perhaps alternating patterns. But no.\n\nWait, in the training examples, the output lists are identical to the input lists except for some sequences replaced with 4s. So the only difference is that certain runs of six or more are replaced with 4s. But the exact rule for which runs to replace is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is done for runs of exactly six or more of the same number, and all elements in those runs are replaced with 4s. That seems to fit most of the examples except for the fourth example in Example 0. But perhaps there's a mistake in my observation of that example.\n\nWait, let me recheck the fourth example of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe output for the 2s run is positions 20-27: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2. So seven 4s and one 2. The input has eight 2s. This doesn't fit the rule of replacing all. So why is the last 2 not replaced? Maybe there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the replacement is not for all elements in the run.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied only if the run is preceded by a certain number. For example, if a run of six or more is preceded by a 3, then replace. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of six or more that are followed by a certain number. Again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most plausible pattern I can see is that any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced entirely with 4s. This fits most of the examples except the fourth example in Example 0. But perhaps there's a mistake in that example, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nIn the test input, for example, there are several runs of eight 8s. Applying this rule would replace them all with 4s. Let's look at the fifth line of the test input:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe run of 8s from position 6 to 15 (ten elements) would be replaced with ten 4s.\n\nAnother line in the test input:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nThe run of 8s from position 6 to 15 is ten elements, replaced with ten 4s. \n\nAnother line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nHere, the run of six 3s (positions 8-13) would be replaced with 4s.\n\nBased on this, I'll proceed under the assumption that any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced entirely with 4s. The discrepancies in the training examples might be due to my miscounting or perhaps exceptions I didn't notice. But given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the test input. For each list in the test input, identify all runs of six or more identical numbers and replace them with 4s."
