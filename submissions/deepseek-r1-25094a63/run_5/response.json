        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and Example 1, there's a transformation happening from the input to the output. Let me start by comparing the input and output arrays to see what's changing.\n\nIn Example 0's first input array:\n[3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\nThe output is the same as the input. So, maybe the first array isn't changed? Let me check the next one.\n\nThe second input in Example 0:\n[8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]\nAgain, the output is the same. So maybe the first two arrays are left as-is. Then the third input array in Example 0:\nInput:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\nAh, here I notice that sequences of the same number are being replaced with 4s. Let's see: starting at position 4 in the input, there's 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), and in the output, they become six 4s. Then later, starting at position 20, there's seven 2s in the input, and in the output, they become seven 4s. So maybe whenever there's a consecutive run of the same number that's longer than a certain length, they get replaced with 4s?\n\nBut wait, the first two arrays in Example 0's input didn't change. So maybe the pattern is that in each array, starting from the third array (index 2?), some runs are replaced. Wait, no. Let me check other examples. Let's look at Example 1's input. The first array in Example 1's input and output are the same. The second array in Example 1's input and output are the same. The third array in Example 1's input has a sequence of 6s, which in the output become 4s. So the pattern is: in each array, consecutive runs of a number (maybe of length 6 or more?) get replaced by 4s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third input array, the first run is six 8s (positions 4-9), replaced by six 4s. Then the next run is seven 2s (positions 20-26), replaced by seven 4s. Similarly, in Example 1's third input array, there's a run of nine 6s (positions 5-13), which becomes nine 4s. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's fourth input array:\nInput:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\nHere, the 6 8s are replaced with 4s, and the 7 2s (positions 20-26) become 4s, and the next two 2s (positions 27-28) remain. So the threshold must be 6 or more. So the rule seems to be: for any consecutive sequence of the same number of length 6 or more, replace each element in that sequence with 4.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 0's fifth input array:\nInput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,3,1,1,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,8,3]\nOutput: [1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,... then the 7 2s become 4s. So yes. So the pattern is that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s. \n\nWait, but in some cases, like Example 0's 8th input array (index 8), the input and output are the same. Let's check. The input is:\n[3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\nLooking at this array, are there any runs of 6 or more? Let's see: the elements are mostly single or short runs. So the output remains the same. So that makes sense. So the rule is, for each array, wherever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, replace all elements in that run with 4s. The rest remain the same.\n\nTesting this against other examples. For example, in Example 0's 12th input array (index 12):\nInput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\nOutput: [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\nHere, the last part has six 3s (positions 22-27) replaced by six 4s. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each array, look for consecutive sequences of the same number. If the length is 6 or more, replace each element in that sequence with 4. Other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, the test input has 30 arrays. Let's process each array according to this rule.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nCheck for runs of 6 or more. Let's go through each element:\n\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3,3,3: three in a row. Not enough.\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 1: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1,1,1: three.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2,2: two.\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n\nNo runs of 6 here. So the output is the same as the input.\n\nNext array:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nCheck for runs. Let's see:\n\n- 1: single.\n- 6,6: two.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 1: single.\n- 3,3: two.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 2: single.\n- 1,1: two.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8,8: two.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8,8: three. Not enough.\n\nNo runs of 6. So output same.\n\nThird array in test input:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking for runs. The part from position 21 to 26 (indices 20 to 25 in 0-based) is 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace with six 4s. So the output array would have 4s there. Let me see:\n\nOriginal array:\nIndices 20-25 (assuming 0-based): positions 21-26 are seven elements (if the array is 30 elements, indexes 0-29). Wait, the array is [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\nAfter index 20: elements are 2,1,1,1,1,1,1. Wait, index 20 is 2, then 21 is 1, 22 is 1, 23 is 1, 24 is 1, 25 is 1, 26 is 1. So that's six 1s (indices 21-26). So this run is six 1s. So replace with six 4s. The rest remains the same. So the output array would have 4s starting at position 21 (original index 21) to 26.\n\nSo the output array for this third input would be:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nYes. So that's how it would look.\n\nContinuing this process for each array in the test input. Let's check the fourth array in the test input:\n\nFourth test array:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's see:\n\nStarting at position 6 (element 8), the sequence is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 consecutive 8s. So replace all 10 with 4s. Then from position 20 (element 1), there are seven 1s (positions 20-26). So replace those seven 1s with 4s. So the output array would have 4s from positions 6 to 15 (10 elements), and positions 20-26 (7 elements).\n\nSo the output for this array would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nWait, wait. Let's count:\n\nOriginal array elements:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:8, 5:6, then from index 6 to 15 (inclusive) are 10 8s. So replace those with 4s. Then from index 19 (element 1) onward: index 19 is 1, then 20-26 are seven 1s. So indices 19 is 1, 20-26 (7 elements) are 1s. Wait, the array is:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nAfter position 5 (6th element), indexes 6 to 15: 10 8s. So replace those 10 with 4s. Then, indexes 19 (element 1), then indexes 20-26: seven 1s. So indexes 20-26 are seven 1s, so replace those with 4s.\n\nSo the output array for this would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nYes. Because the run starts at index 6 (element 8) and goes for 10 elements, all replaced by 4s. Then the run of seven 1s starting at index 20 (original elements 20-26) replaced by 4s.\n\nAnother test array: fifth test input array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (assuming 0-based) are 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, indexes 16-17 are two 1s. Then index 20 (element 6) is single. Then indexes 21-25 are five 1s (not enough). The run of six 1s would be needed, but here it's five. Wait, indexes 21-25: 1,1,1,1,1 (five 1s). So no replacement. But wait, the element at index 26 is 6, which is a single. So this array's output would replace the 10 8s with 4s. So the output array would be:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nAnother test array: sixth array in test input:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The first four 3s (indexes 0-3) are four, not enough. Then at index 4:8, then 3, then starting at index 6, there's a run of 8s: from index 6 to 15 (assuming 0-based). Let's see: indexes 6-15: 10 8s. So replace with 4s. Then indexes 20:6, 21:2, then indexes 22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), so replace those with 4s. So the output array would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,1,1,6,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3]\n\nYes. Because the run from 6-15 (10 8s) becomes 4s. Then the run from 22-27 (six 8s) becomes 4s.\n\nSo applying this rule to each array in the test input, replacing any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number with 4s, and leaving others as is."
