        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Let's start by looking closely at the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output have some differences. Let's compare each input list with the corresponding output. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nI notice that in the input, there's a sequence of 8's starting at index 4 (positions 5 to 10) which in the output becomes 4's. Similarly, the sequence of 2's from index 20 to 26 (positions 21 to 27) becomes 4's. So maybe the pattern is replacing consecutive repeated numbers with a different number, perhaps the count of how many there are? Wait, but 8's are replaced by 4's here, and the count of 8's in that first sequence is 6 (positions 5-10 inclusive, that's 6 elements). Hmm, 6 in the count, but replaced by 4. That doesn't match. Wait, maybe 4 is the number of elements in that consecutive run? Wait, no, because 6 elements are replaced by 6 instances of 4. So the count is 6, but each element is replaced by 4. That's not directly matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the length of the consecutive run. Let's see: the first run of 8's in the input is 6 elements long (positions 5-10). The output replaces each with 4. Wait, 4 is half of 8. Maybe they are dividing by 2? But 8/2 is 4, yes. But other numbers? Let's check another part. The second run in the same input is 2's from index 20 to 26, which is 7 elements (positions 21-27: 7 elements). But they are replaced by 4's. Wait, 2's replaced by 4's. 2*2=4. So maybe each element in a consecutive run is replaced by the length of the run multiplied by the original number. Wait, no. For the first run: 8's, length 6. 6*8=48, but they are replaced by 4's. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, the run length is replaced by a certain value. Maybe runs of a certain length are replaced by a specific number. Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at another example in Example 0: the fourth input list is [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]. The output becomes [1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]. Here, the 8's in positions 5-10 (6 elements) are replaced by 4's again, and the 2's from 20-26 (7 elements) are replaced by 4's. So for both 8's and 2's, when there's a consecutive run of 6 or 7 elements, they get replaced by 4. That doesn't seem to directly tie the original number or the length. Maybe the replacement is always 4 for runs longer than a certain length. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the third input list in the input is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. The output becomes [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. Here, the run of 6's (positions 5-13) which is 9 elements (from index 5 to 13 inclusive: 9 elements) is replaced by 4's. So 9 elements replaced by 4's. Wait, maybe the replacement is 4 regardless of the original number, but only when the run length is exactly 6? But in the first example, the run of 8's was 6 elements and replaced by 4. In the second example, the run of 6's was 9 elements, replaced by 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's runs of 6 or more elements. Let's see. In Example 0, the first run that's replaced is 6 elements (8's), then 7 elements (2's). In the third input list of Example 0, the runs that are replaced are 6 elements (8's) and 7 elements (2's), both replaced by 4's. In Example 1, the third input has a run of 9 elements (6's) replaced by 4's. So the pattern might be: any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4's. But wait, in the first example's input list 8 (the ninth input list), there's a run of 8's in the input:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\n\nOutput is the same as input. So if there's no run of 6 or more, no replacement. So perhaps the rule is that any consecutive run of exactly 6 elements is replaced by 4's. Wait, but in the first example's third input, the run of 8's is 6 elements (positions 5-10) and replaced by 4's. The next run of 2's is 7 elements (positions 20-26), and those are replaced by 4's as well. So maybe runs of 6 or more are replaced by 4's. But in Example 1, the third input's run of 6's is 9 elements, replaced by 4's. So perhaps the rule is that any run of length >=6 is replaced with 4's for all elements in the run.\n\nBut why 4? Let's check other examples. In Example 0, the first output list is the same as the input. Let's check the input for that one. The first input list in Example 0 doesn't have any runs of 6 or more. The second input list in Example 0's input is the same as output. Let's check for runs. The second input list in Example 0 is [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]. Looking for runs of 6 or more. The 8's at positions 6, then another 8 at position 12-13 (two 8's), etc. No runs of 6. So output is same as input. \n\nIn the third input of Example 0, there's a run of six 8's and seven 2's, replaced by 4's. So that's the pattern. So whenever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, replace each element in the run with the number 4. Let's check another example. In Example 1's input lists, let's look at the third input again. The run of 6's is 9 elements, replaced by 4's. Another example: in Example 1's input list 17 (assuming 0-based), the input is [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]. The output is [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]. Here, the run of 8's from index 13 to 19 (7 elements) is replaced by 4's. So that's a run of 7 elements. So the rule seems to be: replace every consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4's in all positions of that run.\n\nBut wait, why 4? Maybe because the original number is divided by 2. For example, 8 becomes 4 (8/2=4), 6 becomes 3 (but in some examples, 6's are replaced by 4's, which contradicts that). Wait, in Example 0's third input, the 8's become 4's (8/2), but the 2's become 4's as well (2*2). So that theory doesn't hold. Maybe the replacement number is fixed as 4 regardless of the original number. So any run of 6 or more same numbers is replaced by 4's. So the pattern is: in any consecutive run of 6 or more identical elements, replace each element in the run with 4. Let's verify this with all examples.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's fourth input list:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, the run of 8's is 6 elements (positions 5-10) replaced by 4's, and the run of 2's is 7 elements (positions 20-26) replaced by 4's. But in the output, the last element of the 2's run is replaced by 2 again. Wait, the input's 2's run is from index 20 to 26 (7 elements), and the output replaces positions 20-26 (7 elements) with 4's except the last one? Wait no, let's count. The input is positions 20: 2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2. Wait that's 8 elements (indices 20 to 27 inclusive). Oh wait, in the output, the output list ends at position 27 as 2. So the input run is 8 elements (all 2's from index 20-27), but in the output, the first seven are replaced with 4's and the last one remains 2? That can't be. Wait the output is [..., 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]. So the 8 elements (positions 20-27) in the input are 8 2's, but in the output, the first 7 are 4's and the last is 2. That breaks the pattern. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the input again:\n\nOriginal input list for fourth example in Example 0:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nIndices 0-29. The run of 2's starts at index 20 (value 2), then 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2. That's 8 elements (indices 20-27 inclusive). The output for these positions is:\n\n20:4, 21:4, 22:4, 23:4, 24:4, 25:4, 26:4, 27:2. Wait, why is the last one 2? That's inconsistent. Unless the run is exactly 7 elements? Wait, indices 20-26 is 7 elements (20 to 26 inclusive is 7 elements), and index 27 is another 2. So the run is split into 7 and 1? But that doesn't make sense. So maybe the run is 8 elements, but the replacement is only for runs of 6 or more. So 8 elements should all be replaced. But in the output, only the first 7 are replaced. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's count the elements. The input list has 30 elements. Let's list them:\n\nIndices 0-29:\n\n0:1, 1:2, 2:8, 3:1, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8 (positions 4-9: 6 elements, 8's), then 10:3, etc.\n\nThen starting at index 20:\n\n20:2, 21:2, 22:2, 23:2, 24:2, 25:2, 26:2, 27:2 (indices 20-27: 8 elements). So the run is 8 elements. The output replaces positions 20-26 (7 elements) with 4, but leaves index 27 as 2. That's odd. So maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly 6 or 7, but not longer? That complicates things. But that's not consistent with the other examples. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to the first 6 elements of any run longer than or equal to 6. Let's check.\n\nIn the third input of Example 0, the run of 8's is 6 elements (positions 4-9). They are replaced by 6 4's. Then the run of 2's is 7 elements (positions 20-26) replaced by 7 4's. But in the fourth example's input, the run of 2's is 8 elements, but only the first 7 are replaced. Wait, but in the output of the fourth example, the run of 2's in positions 20-26 (7 elements) are replaced, and the 27th is 2. Wait, maybe the run is split. Let me check the input again: the 2's start at 20 and go to 27. That's 8 elements. So why isn't the entire run replaced? Unless there's another condition. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of exactly 6 or more, but after replacement, the remaining elements are left as is. But that doesn't fit. Or maybe the replacement starts when a run reaches 6 elements, but continues replacing until the end of the run. So in the case of a run of 8 elements, all 8 are replaced. But in the fourth example's output, position 27 is 2, which would mean that the run was 8 elements, but only 7 were replaced. That doesn't fit. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check the example again. The fourth input in Example 0's input is:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nWait, the output for the 2's run starts at index 20 (0-based) as 4, and goes to index 26 (7 elements: 20-26 inclusive). Then index 27 is 2. So the input run is 8 elements (20-27), but the output replaces only the first 7. This contradicts the previous pattern. So perhaps the pattern isn't just replacing runs of 6 or more. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nWait, maybe the runs to be replaced are exactly of length 6, and longer runs are left as is except for the first 6. Or perhaps the replacement is only for runs that start at certain positions. Alternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs that are preceded by a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of exactly 6 elements, but in some cases, if a longer run exists, only the first 6 are replaced, but that doesn't fit with the earlier example where a 7-element run is fully replaced. \n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my initial hypothesis might be incorrect. Let's look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for where the 4's appear in the output. The number 4 is not present in the input lists. So the transformation introduces 4's. The 4's seem to replace certain runs. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the sum of the consecutive elements is being used. For example, a run of 6 elements of 8: sum is 48, which could be 4 and 8. But how would that translate to replacing each element with 4. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, the average of the run. 48/6=8, which is the same as the elements, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 4 represents the number of times the digit appears in the entire list. But in the third example of Example 0, there are 6 8's in the first run. The total count of 8's in the input list would be more than 6. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the position in the list. For example, if the run starts at position 4, then 4 is used as the replacement. But why 4? In the third input of Example 0, the run of 8's starts at position 4 (index 4, 0-based), and they are replaced by 4's. But in the fourth example's run of 2's, the run starts at index 20. 20 modulo 4 is 0, but that doesn't explain the 4. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement is always 4, and the rule is that consecutive runs of exactly 6 or more elements are replaced by 4's. But the fourth example's run of 8 elements (2's) is replaced by 7 4's and 1 2. That's inconsistent. \n\nWait, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of 6 or more elements, but only the first 6 elements are replaced. Let's check that. \n\nIn the third example of Example 0, the run of 8's is 6 elements, replaced by 6 4's. The run of 2's is 7 elements, replaced by 7 4's. So that would fit. Then, in the fourth example, the run of 8's (6 elements) is replaced by 6 4's. The run of 2's is 8 elements, so replaced by 8 4's. Wait, but in the fourth example's output, the last element of the 2's run is 2, not 4. That contradicts. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement depends on the original number. For example, runs of 6 or more of even numbers are replaced by 4, while odd numbers are replaced by something else. But in the fourth example, the 2's (even) are replaced by 4's. The 8's (even) are replaced by 4's. But then in the first example's third input, the 2's (even) are replaced by 4's. So maybe all even numbers in runs of 6 or more are replaced by 4. But what about odd numbers? Let's look for runs of odd numbers. For example, let's check if there are any runs of 6 or more odd numbers replaced by something.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input list:\n\nInput: [6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2]\n\nOutput is the same as input. No runs of 6 here. \n\nLooking at Example 1's second input list:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2, 6, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3]\n\nOutput is same as input. \n\nLooking at Example 1's third input list:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the run of 6's is 9 elements, replaced by 4's. 6 is even. So again, even number run replaced by 4. \n\nIn Example 1's sixth input list:\n\nInput: [2, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 8]\n\nOutput: [2,6,3,2,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,8,3,3,6,3,1,8,8,1,2,3,1,8,8]\n\nThe run of 6's (even) is replaced by 4's.\n\nBut what about a run of odd numbers? Let's see if there's any example. For instance, in Example 0's 8th input list:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\n\nOutput is the same as input. Looking for runs: there's a run of 1's at positions 23-24 (two 1's), which is not long enough. So no runs of 6. \n\nAnother example: in Example 1's 17th input list:\n\nInput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nOutput: [8,1,3,6,8,8,6,6,3,3,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,3,8,2,3,6,2,8,2]\n\nThe run of 8's (7 elements) is replaced by 4's. 8 is even. \n\nBut I can't find any examples where a run of odd numbers is replaced by 4's. Perhaps the replacement is only for even numbers. But then, what if there's a run of odd numbers? For example, a run of 6 3's. Are they replaced by something else? \n\nLooking at the test input provided. Let's look at the third test input list:\n\nTest input list 3:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking at positions 20-26: 1's from index 20 to 26 (7 elements). If the rule is to replace runs of even numbers with 4's, but this is a run of 1's (odd), it should not be replaced. But according to the pattern, maybe odd runs are replaced by a different number. But I don't see any examples of that in the training data. All examples of replaced runs involve even numbers. So perhaps the rule is that runs of 6 or more even numbers are replaced by 4's. \n\nBut in the fourth example of Example 0's input, the run of 2's (even) is replaced by 4's except the last element. But according to the rule, the entire run should be replaced. This inconsistency suggests I might have misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of 6 or more elements, regardless of their value, and replaced by 4. But in the fourth example of Example 0, the run of 8 elements (2's) is replaced by 7 4's and one 2, which doesn't fit. So maybe there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the run is not consecutive. Let me check the input again. In the fourth example of Example 0's input list:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nThe run of 2's starts at index 20 and goes to index 27 (8 elements). The output is:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,2,1,1,2,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,1,3]\n\nSo positions 20-26 (7 elements) are replaced with 4's, and position 27 remains 2. That's a total of 8 elements in the run. So why the last one is not replaced? Maybe the run is split into two parts. For example, perhaps there's a different element in between. But the input shows all are 2's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of exactly 6, 7, or 8 elements, but how? Maybe it's the first 6 elements replaced. Let's see: in the run of 8 elements (2's), the first 7 are replaced. That's inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to runs of 6 or more elements, but the replacement number is determined by the original number. For even numbers, replaced by 4 (even/2), for odd numbers, replaced by (original number +1)/2. For example, if the run is of 3's (odd), then replaced by 2. But in the training examples, there are no such cases. \n\nBut in the fourth example's run of 2's (even), 2/2=1, but they are replaced by 4. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is quite confusing. Let's try to look for other patterns. Perhaps the 4 is the number of distinct elements in the run. But all elements in the run are the same, so that's 1. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: the position of the run. For example, the run starts at index 4 (5th position), so replaced by 4. But in the third example of Example 0, the run starts at index 4 (8's) and is replaced by 4's. In the fourth example's run of 8's, starts at index 4. So maybe the replacement number is 4 if the run starts at index 4. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement is 4 for runs in certain positions, but that seems arbitrary. \n\nLet me look at Example 1's fourth input list:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 8, 2, 6, 2, 1, 8, 3, 3, 8]\n\nOutput: [8,6,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,1,1,2,1,2,6,8,2,6,2,1,8,3,3,8]\n\nThe run of 6's starts at index 5 (value 6) and runs for 9 elements. Replaced by 4's. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, regardless of what it is, is replaced by 4's. But why in the fourth example of Example 0, a run of 8 2's is replaced by 7 4's and one 2. That suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps there's another rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is done only once per list, or there's a priority. Or perhaps the runs are counted from left to right, and once a run is processed, subsequent elements are not considered. For example, the run of 8 elements (2's) could be split into a run of 6 and then 2, but in that case, the first 6 would be replaced, and the remaining 2 would remain. Let's see:\n\nIn the fourth example's input, the 8 2's: the first 6 are replaced, the last 2 remain. But in the output, the first 7 are replaced. That doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the replacement starts at the first element of the run and replaces the next 6 elements. So in an 8-element run, positions 0-5 are replaced, and 6-7 remain. But in the output, positions 20-26 (7 elements) are replaced. That doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let's try to find another approach. Let's look at the test input and see if we can apply the pattern we're hypothesizing. \n\nFor the test input, let's take the third test list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more identical numbers. Let's look for sequences:\n\nFrom index 21: 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6.\n\nSo starting at index 21: 1's. The elements are 1 (index 21), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 (index 26). That's 6 elements (positions 21-26). This run is exactly 6 elements. According to the hypothesized rule, these should be replaced by 4's. So in the output, positions 21-26 would become 4's. The next element is 8, which is not part of the run. \n\nAnother test input list: the fourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. From index 20: 1's. Indexes 20-26 (7 elements) are 1's. So this is a run of 7 elements. According to the rule, replaced by 4's. \n\nAnother test input list: the fifth test input:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nLooking at the run of 8's starting at index 4 (8,6, then 8,8,8, etc.). Wait, index 4 is 8, index 5 is 6. So the run of 8's starts at index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Let's see: index 6 is 8, then 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8. That's 9 elements (indexes 6-14). So this run is 9 elements. According to the rule, replaced by 4's. \n\nSimilarly, the seventh test input list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nThe run of 8's starts at index 6 and goes to 15 (10 elements). Replaced by 4's. \n\nAssuming the pattern is replacing runs of 6 or more with 4's, let's apply that to the test input. \n\nBut why in the fourth example of Example 0's input, the run of 8 2's is replaced by 7 4's and one 2? That's still a mystery. Could it be a mistake in the example? Or perhaps there's another rule. Maybe the replacement is applied only to runs of even numbers, but the count of elements is even. For example, a run of 6 (even) elements of even numbers replaced by 4's, and runs of even elements (like 8) would be replaced. But in the fourth example's run of 8 elements (even count), but only 7 are replaced. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of even numbers with even lengths, but that's not the case in the examples. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I think the most consistent pattern is that any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4's. The fourth example's output may have a typo, or perhaps there's an exception I'm missing, but given that most examples follow this rule, I'll proceed with that hypothesis.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. For each list in the test input, check for consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers and replace each element in such runs with 4.\n\nLet's take the third test input list:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n- The first two elements are 8's. Only two, so no replacement.\n- At the end of the list, there's a run of six 1's from index 21 to 26. Replace these six with 4's.\n\nSo the output for this list would have 4's from positions 21-26.\n\nSimilarly, the fourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nThe run of seven 1's from index 20-26. Replace with 4's.\n\nThe fifth test input list:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe run of 9 8's from index 6-14. Replace with 4's.\n\nThe seventh test input list:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nThe run of 8's from index 6-15 (10 elements). Replace with 4's.\n\nThe eighth test input list:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nThe run of 8's from index 4-15 (12 elements). Replace with 4's.\n\nSo applying this rule to all test input lists, replacing any run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4's. Now, I'll generate the output for each test input list accordingly."
