        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the problem is to take an input list of numbers and transform it into an output list following some rule. The training examples show that certain elements in the input are replaced with 4s in the output. Let's look at Example 0 first.\n\nIn Example 0's input, looking at the third array (the third line of input), the input starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The output for this is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]. I notice that a sequence of six 8s starting at position 4 (0-based index 4) are replaced with six 4s. Then, later in the array, there are seven 2s starting at index 20, which become seven 4s. So, sequences of repeated numbers are being replaced with 4s. But wait, how long do these sequences need to be?\n\nLooking at other examples. Take the first array in Example 0's input: the input has [3,3,2,6,...], and the output is the same. There's a 3,3 at the start but those are left as-is. So maybe the replacement occurs only when the run is longer than a certain length. Let's check the third array again. The first replaced part is six 8s, which became six 4s. The second part is seven 2s. So maybe runs of 6 or more consecutive identical numbers are replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nBut let's check another example. In Example 1's input, the third array is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The output for this is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The sequence of nine 6s starting at index 5 are replaced with nine 4s. The other parts, like the two 6s (6,6 at indices 17 and 18) remain as 6,6. So this supports the idea that runs of 6 or more identical numbers are replaced with 4s.\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's first input array, there's a run of three 8s (indices 5,6,7), but they remain as 8,8,8 in the output. So runs shorter than 6 are left as-is. Only runs of 6 or longer are replaced with 4s.\n\nLet me check another part. In Example 0, the 13th input array is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output for this is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. The input has six 3s starting at index 20 (indices 20-25), which are replaced by six 4s. The run is exactly six elements, so that's the threshold. So, any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers becomes 4s, and shorter runs are left as is.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's take the fifth line of the test input:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nLooking for sequences of 6 or more same numbers. Starting from index 6 (assuming 0-based), the sequence of 8s: from index 6 to 15. That's 10 elements (8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). So this entire run would be replaced with 4s of the same length. Then, later in the array, from index 22 to 26 (1,1,1,1,1,1) \u2014 that's six 1s. So those would become 4s as well.\n\nAnother test input line is the fourth line: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The input has a run of 8s starting at index 6 (after 8,6) from index 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements). So replace with 4s. Then, after that, there's a run of seven 1s starting at index 20 (positions 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1) \u2014 seven elements. Replace those with 4s. The 8 at index 26 is a single 8, so remains.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each array of the input, replace every consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's check the test input and apply this rule.\n\nLooking at the test input arrays one by one:\n\nTest Input Line 0: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nCheck for runs of 6. Let's see:\n\n- 3,3,3: only 3 elements. No.\n- 8,8 (at indices 9-10): 2 elements. No.\n- 1,1,1 (indices 17-19): 3. No.\n- 1,1,2, etc.: No. So this line remains unchanged.\n\nTest Input Line 1: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nLooking for runs of 6. The 8,8,8 at the end (indices 26-28) is only 3. No. No runs of 6 here. So this line remains same.\n\nTest Input Line 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking at index 21 to 26: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So this run is replaced with six 4s. The rest of the array is okay. So the output for this line would have 4s from index 21 to 26.\n\nTest Input Line 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nHere, starting at index 21: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So replaced with seven 4s. The rest are okay.\n\nTest Input Line 4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nThe run of 8s from index 6 to 15 (after 8,6) is 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, the run of 1s from index 20 to 26: seven 1s. Replace with 4s. The 8 at index 26 is single, remains.\n\nTest Input Line 5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15 (after 8,6) are 10 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then, the 1s from index 22 to 26: five 1s (indices 22-26 are 1,1,1,1,1, but wait, index 22 is 1, and up to index 26 (inclusive), that's 5 elements? Wait, the input is [...,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. So indices 22-26 (assuming 0-based) would be positions 22:6, then 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:1, 27:1. Wait, let me recount the array. Let's look at the array:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nThe elements from index 6 (assuming 0-based) are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (indices 6 to 15 inclusive: 10 elements) \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then, after that, looking for other runs. Starting at index 20:6, then 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:1 (indices 21-26: 6 elements) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nSo from index 21 to 26: six 1s. So replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nThe run of 8s from index 6 to 15 (after 8,3): 10 8s \u2192 4s. Then, the 8s from index 22 to 27 (8,8,8,8,8,8) \u2192 six 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nThe 8s start at index 6 to 16 (8,8,...,8) \u2192 11 elements \u2192 replaced with 4s. The rest are okay.\n\nTest Input Line 8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15 (after 8,3) \u2192 10 elements \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then, the 8s at indices 16-18: three 8s (after the 6), so no. Then, 8,8,8 at indices 19-21 (no, wait the array is [...,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,...]. Let me check:\n\nOriginal line: indices 6 is 8 (assuming the input is [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1].\n\nSo after index 5 (which is 3), indices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 \u2192 10 elements \u2192 replaced. Then the 6 at index 16, then 8,8,8 (indices 17-19) \u2192 3 elements, so no replacement.\n\nTest Input Line 9: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15: 10 elements \u2192 replaced. Then the 8,8,8 at the end (indices 26-28) \u2192 three, so no.\n\nTest Input Line 10: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nThe run of 8s from index 5 to 14: 10 elements \u2192 replaced. Also, the 8,8,8 at indices 5-14 (assuming the input is [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,...] \u2192 from index 5 to 15 (since the next is 3) \u2192 11 elements \u2192 replaced. Then, after that, the 1s at indices 25-27: three 1s \u2192 no replacement.\n\nTest Input Line 11: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nLooking for runs of 6. The 2,2 in indices 8-9: two. 3,3 at indices 20-21: two. 6,3, etc. No runs of 6. So unchanged.\n\nTest Input Line 12: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nLooking for runs.

The 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices 15-20: six elements \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 21: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\n\nThe 3s from index 15 to 21: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 seven elements \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 22: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\n\nThe 3s from indices 16-21: six 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s. The 8s at indices 5 (8), 10-12 (three 8s) \u2192 no.\n\nTest Input Line 23: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nThe 3s from indices 16-22: seven 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 24: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n\nThe 3s from indices 16-22: seven 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Also, the 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 at 16-22 \u2192 seven 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 25: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n\nThe 2s at indices 5-8: four 2s. The 3s from 13-20: eight 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 26: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nThe 3s from indices 9-14 (assuming 3,3,3,3,3,3,6) \u2192 indices 9-14: six 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input Line 27: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\n\nThe 8s from indices 8-11: four \u2192 no.\n\nTest Input Line 28: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\n\nThe 3s from indices 6-9: four \u2192 no.\n\nTest Input Line 29: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nSo, applying this pattern to each array in the test input, wherever there's a consecutive run of six or more identical numbers, replace that entire run with 4s. All other elements remain the same."
