        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially the first one. The input lists a bunch of numbers, and the output changes some of them to 4s. Let me compare the input and output of example 0.\n\nIn the input for example 0, there's a part where the second line starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The output for this line becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]. So, the original sequence had eight 8s followed by seven 2s. In the output, those sequences are replaced with 4s. The 8s from positions 4-9 (indices 4 to 9) are replaced with six 4s, and the 2s from positions 20-26 (indices 20 to 26) are replaced with seven 4s. Wait, but the count here\u2014maybe the rule is that any consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number gets replaced by 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The third input line is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2], and the output changes the 6s starting from position 5 (after the 3) into nine 4s. So in the input, there are nine consecutive 6s. The output replaces them with nine 4s. Wait, but in the first example, the 8s were six in a row, and they were replaced by six 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of exactly six or more same numbers is replaced by the same number of 4s. But wait, in the first example's output, the 8s (six in a row) became six 4s, and the 2s (seven in a row) became seven 4s. So the replacement is for runs of six or more, replacing each element in the run with 4, keeping the same length.\n\nNow let's check the test input. The third line in the test input is [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]. Looking at this, the sequence from index 20 (assuming 0-based) is seven 1s (positions 20-25, maybe? Let me count: the elements are 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8,... So starting from index 21 (the first 1 after 2), there are six 1s in a row. Wait, the elements are 2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8. So from index 21 to 26 (assuming the list is 0-based), there are six 1s. So in the output, those six 1s would become six 4s. So the output line would have 4s there.\n\nAnother test input line is the fourth line: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]. Here, starting from index 6 (the first 8 after 6), there's a run of eight 8s. Then later, from index 19 (the 1 after 3), there are seven 1s. Both of these runs would be replaced with 4s. So the output would have 4s in those positions.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in each list of numbers, any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by the same number of 4s. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each line in the test input and check for runs of six or more same numbers. Then replace those runs with 4s of the same length.\n\nLet's process each line one by one:\n\nTest Input Line 1: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check consecutive counts. The first few numbers: 6,8,3,3,3,8. So 3,3,3 is a run of 3. Then 8, then 3,8,8: no. Then 1,8,3,8,8,1: not a run. Then 6,3,1,2,3,1: no. Then 1,1,1: three 1s. Then 3,1,2,2: two 2s. So no runs of 6 here. So this line remains the same.\n\nTest Input Line 2: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\nLooking for runs. The 8,8 at positions 3-4, but only two. Then 8,8 again at 10-11. The 8,8,8 at 26-28 (indices 26,27,28) is three 8s. So no runs of six. So this line remains the same.\n\nTest Input Line 3: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\nHere, starting at index 21 (element 1), there are six consecutive 1s (positions 21-26, elements 1,1,1,1,1,1). So this run of six 1s is replaced by six 4s. The rest of the line remains the same.\n\nTest Input Line 4: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\nLooking for runs. From index 20 (element 1) to 26: seven 1s. So this run is replaced by seven 4s. The rest remains.\n\nTest Input Line 5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\nHere, starting at index 6 (element 8), there are nine 8s (positions 6-14). This run is replaced by nine 4s. Then later, starting at index 21 (element 1), there's a run of five 1s (positions 21-25), which is five, not six. So only the nine 8s are replaced.\n\nTest Input Line 6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\nIn this line, the first four 3s are a run of four, so no. Then from index 5 (element 8) onwards, there's a run of 8s. Let's count: positions 4 (8?), let's check again. The line is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. Wait, the fifth element is 8 (index 4), then 3 (index5), then 8 starting at index6. So the 8s from index6 to index15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (count 10). So this run of ten 8s is replaced by ten 4s. Then later, starting at index22 (element8), there's a run of six 8s (positions22-27). So this is also replaced by six 4s. So both runs are replaced.\n\nTest Input Line 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\nHere, from index6 (8) to index16 (8), that's 11 8s. So replaced by 11 4s. Then later, three 8s at positions25-27, which is only three, so no replacement.\n\nTest Input Line 8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\nThe run of 8s starts at index6 (8) to index15 (8) which is 10 8s. Replaced by 10 4s. Then three 8s at index18-20, which is three, so no.\n\nTest Input Line 9: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\nThe 8s from index6 to index15: 10 8s. Replaced by 10 4s.\n\nTest Input Line10: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\nThe 8s from index5 (8) to index14: 10 8s. Then three 8s at the end (positions26-28?), but need to check. The line has 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions5-15) which is 11 8s. So replaced by 11 4s. The 1,1,1 at positions25-27 (if present) is three 1s, so no.\n\nTest Input Line11: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\nLooking for runs. There's a 2,2 in positions 8-9 (two), and three 2s at the end. So no runs of six. This line remains the same.\n\nTest Input Line12: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\nThe 2,2,2,2 in positions10-13 is four, so no. The 3,3,3 in positions14-16 is three. So no replacement here.\n\nTest Input Line13: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]\nNo runs of six. All runs are shorter. So remains the same.\n\nTest Input Line14: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]\nLooking for runs. The 8,8 at the start (two), then 1,1 (positions6-7). The 3,3,3 at positions16-18 (three). Then 8,8,8 (positions19-21: three). Then 3,3,3 again (positions22-24: three). The 1,1 at the end. No runs of six. So no changes.\n\nTest Input Line15: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\nCheck runs. 3,1,1,3,1,1: no. The 8,8 in position13-14. 3,3,3 in positions16-18. Then 3,3,3 in 20-22. All less than six. So no changes.\n\nTest Input Line16: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]\nNo runs of six. The 3,3 in position6-7. 6,6,6 in positions12-14 (three). 8,8,8 in positions20-22 (three). So no replacements.\n\nTest Input Line17: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]\nNo runs of six. The 8,8 at start. 3,3 in position6-7. 8,8 at position9-10. 3,3 in position11-12. 8,8 at positions22-23. So no changes.\n\nTest Input Line18: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]\nNo runs of six here. The 3,3 in positions4-5. 3,3 in position7-8. 1,1 in positions12-13. 1,1 in positions14-15. 3,3 at the end. All short runs.\n\nTest Input Line19: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\nLooking for runs. The first three 8s: positions0-2. Then two 8s at positions5-6. Then six 3s starting at position10 (3,3,3,3,6, then 3,3,3,3,3,3?) Wait, let me recheck. The line is: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Starting at position10 (element3), there's 3,3,3,3 (four), then 6, then starting at position15: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (positions15-20), which is six 3s. So this run of six 3s is replaced by six 4s. The initial three 8s (positions0-2) are three, so no. The 3s from 15-20 (six) are replaced.\n\nTest Input Line20: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\nLooking for runs. The 3s starting at position13 (3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3). Wait, perhaps I need to recount. Line: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. From position13: 3,3, then 1, then starting at position15: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (positions15-20: six 3s). So that run is replaced by six 4s. The 8s at positions21-23 (positions 22,23,24: 8,8,8) is three, so no.\n\nTest Input Line21: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\nLooking for runs.

The 3s from positions13-20: eight 3s. So replaced by eight 4s. Then 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (eight 3s) from positions13-20. So replaced.\n\nTest Input Line26: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\nThe 1,1,1 at positions2-4 (three). The 8,8 at 5-6. 3,3,3 at 7-9 (three). 3,3,3,3,3 at 13-17 (five). The 3s from13-17 are five, so no. The 6 is alone. So no runs of six here. Wait, wait, the line is [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]. The 3s from positions7-9: 3,3,3 (three). Then 3s from13-17: positions13-17 are 3,3,3,3,3 (five). So no six. So no replacement here.\n\nTest Input Line27: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\nThe 8,8,8,8 at positions8-11 (four). The 3,3 at positions1-2. The 3,3,3 at positions3-5 (three). So no runs of six.\n\nTest Input Line28: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\nThe 3,3,3,3 at positions6-9 (four). So no.\n\nTest Input Line29: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\nLooking for runs. The 8,8 at positions7-8 (two). 1,1 at positions10-11. 1,1 at positions13-14. No runs of six.\n\nSo applying this to each line, the output should have 4s in the runs of six or more. Now, let's construct the output lines.\n\nFor example, the third line of test input (line index 2) becomes:\n\nOriginal: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nThe six 1s from positions21-26 (indices 21-26) are replaced by six 4s. So the output line would be:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nSimilarly, other lines are processed.\n\nSo for each line, scan for consecutive runs of the same number with length \u22656, replace each element in those runs with 4."
