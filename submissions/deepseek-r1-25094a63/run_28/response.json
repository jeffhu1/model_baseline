        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list where some of the numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me compare the input and output for the examples given.\n\nStarting with Example 0, the first two input arrays in the example are unchanged in the output. But from the third input array, there's a change. Let me look at the third input array:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, so in the input, starting at position 4 (0-based index 4), there are six consecutive 8s, which are replaced by six 4s in the output. Then, starting at position 20, seven 2s become seven 4s. So maybe the pattern is replacing sequences of the same number with 4s if they meet a certain length?\n\nWait, let me check another example. Let's take the fourth input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, starting at index 4, six 8s become six 4s, and starting at index 20, seven 2s become seven 4s. So maybe any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length? Let's check another example to confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 1's first changed input:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, starting at index 5, there are nine 6s replaced by nine 4s. So the pattern seems to be that any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's see if this holds for other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's eighth input array (the one not changed), there might be no sequences of 6 or more. Let's check:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\n\nLooking at this array, the longest consecutive sequences are maybe two or three in a row. So no replacement, which matches the output where it's unchanged.\n\nAnother example from Example 0: The 13th input array:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOutput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nHere, the sequence starting at index 22 is five 3s followed by a 3. Wait, index 22 is 3, then 3,3,3,3,3? Wait, the input here is [...,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]. Oh wait, the output is [...,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]. So the six 3s starting at index 22 (0-based) are replaced by five 4s and a 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the indices.\n\nWait the input array is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nLooking at the latter part: positions 22 to 27 (assuming 0-based) are 3,3,3,3,3,3. So six 3s. The output replaces those with five 4s and then a 3? Wait, the output for those positions is 4,4,4,4,4,3. Wait that can't be right. Wait the output array is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, positions 22 to 27 in the output are 4,4,4,4,4,3. But the original had six 3s. That would mean only five are replaced. But that contradicts the initial pattern. Wait maybe I made a mistake here. Let me count again. The input array from position 22 is:\n\nIndex 22: 3\n\n23: 3\n\n24: 3\n\n25: 3\n\n26: 3\n\n27: 3\n\nSo six consecutive 3s. The output for these positions is 4,4,4,4,4,3. So five 4s and one 3. That's inconsistent with the previous pattern. Hmm, this is confusing. Did I count wrong?\n\nWait maybe I'm looking at the wrong input array. Let me check again. The 13th input array in Example 0 is:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nWait, no. Wait the 13th input array is different. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the examples. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Example 0's OUTPUT, the 13th array is:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nThe input array (from the input list) for this is:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nSo the input here has at position 22 (if we start counting from 0) the sequence is 3,3,3,3,3,3 (indices 22-27). The output replaces the first five with 4s and leaves the last as 3. Wait, but that's a run of 6, so why not replace all six with 4s? This contradicts the previous pattern. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is different. Let's think again. Maybe the replacement is for sequences of exactly six, or sequences longer than or equal to six. But in this case, six 3s are replaced by five 4s and one 3. That doesn't fit. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait maybe the pattern is that every run of 6 or more same numbers is replaced by 4s, but only starting from the first occurrence. Wait, perhaps the first six elements of the run are replaced by 4s, and the rest remain? Let's check.\n\nIn the previous example, the input has six 3s. The output shows five 4s followed by a 3. But that's six elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six. Let's see in the third input of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\n\nThe run of eight 8s (indices 4-9) becomes six 4s. Wait, wait, in the output it's replaced by six 4s (positions 4-9). So the original was six 8s (indices 4-9?), wait let me count:\n\nOriginal input array positions 4-9: indexes 4 to 9 (since Python uses 0-based):\n\nindexes 4: 8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8. That's six 8s. So they are replaced by six 4s. Then in the next part, the 2s start at index 20: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2. That's seven 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So in that case, a run of 6 becomes six 4s, a run of seven becomes seven 4s. So why in the 13th input array's example, the run of six 3s is replaced by five 4s?\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nThe 13th input array in Example 0's input is:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\n\nThe output for this array is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nWait the sequence of six 3s starts at index 22 (0-based) and ends at index 27. But the output replaces indexes 22-26 (five elements) with 4s, and leaves index 27 as 3. Wait that's a run of six, but only five are replaced. That's confusing. So maybe my initial pattern assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another factor. Let's look for other patterns. Maybe the position where the run occurs matters. For example, maybe after a certain position in the array, runs are replaced. Or perhaps the first run of six or more is replaced, and others are not. But in Example 0's third input array, there are two runs (of 8s and 2s) that are both replaced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but only once per array. But in the third input array of Example 0, two runs are replaced, which would contradict that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but only if they are followed by a different number. Wait, but in the first case, the six 8s are followed by 1,3, etc. The seven 2s are followed by 3. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six, but in that case, the example with nine 6s in Example 1's input would be replaced by nine 4s, which they are. But the example with six 8s is replaced by six 4s. So why in the 13th example, six 3s are replaced by five 4s and a 3?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in my observation. Let me recount the indexes for that example.\n\nOriginal input array:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\nIndices 0:8, 1:6, 2:2, 3:8, 4:2,5:2,6:2,7:3,8:3,9:8,10:1,11:1,12:3,13:1,14:6,15:1,16:3,17:2,18:8,19:3,20:8,21:3,22:3,23:3,24:3,25:3,26:3,27:1,28:8,29:1.\n\nSo the run of six 3s starts at index 22 (value 3), then indexes 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3. Wait no, index 27 is 1. So the run is from 22 to 27? No, index 27 is 1, so the run is 22-26 (five elements?), but that's five 3s. Wait, no: indexes 22 is 3, 23:3, 24:3, 25:3, 26:3, 27:1. Wait no, the original input's 27th element is 1. So the run is from 22 to 26 (five elements), which is five 3s. But the output has 4s from 22 to 26 and then 1 at 27. Wait, but the output is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]\n\nSo indexes 22-26 are replaced with 4s. That's five elements. But the original input has five 3s in that run (indexes 22-26). So that would mean a run of five 3s, but according to the previous examples, runs of six or more are replaced. So why is this replaced?\n\nThis contradicts the initial hypothesis. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of five or more. Let's check:\n\nIn the third input array of Example 0, the first run is six 8s (replaced by six 4s). The second run is seven 2s (replaced by seven 4s). So that fits if the threshold is five or more. Then in the 13th input array, a run of five 3s would be replaced by five 4s. Which aligns with what's observed here. So maybe the pattern is to replace runs of five or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nLet me check another example. In Example 1's third input array:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the run of nine 6s is replaced by nine 4s. So that's a run longer than five. So that fits.\n\nAnother example: the 17th input array in Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nThe input has a run of seven 1s starting at index 10. These are replaced by seven 4s. So that's a run of seven, which is longer than five. So the threshold seems to be runs of five or more.\n\nWait in the 13th input array example in Example 0, the run of five 3s is replaced by five 4s. So this suggests that the threshold is five or more. So any consecutive sequence of five or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nLet me verify this against other examples. For instance, in Example 1's input:\n\nThe first input array is unchanged. Let's check for runs of five or more. The first array in Example 1's input is:\n\n[6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2]\n\nLooking for runs of five or more. There's a run of four 8s (positions 3-6) and two 6s (positions 7-8). So no runs of five. Hence, the output is the same as input.\n\nAnother example in Example 1's input:\n\nThe second input array in Example 1's input is:\n\n[2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2, 6, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs of five or more. There's a run of four 8s at positions 16-19. So no replacement. Hence output is same as input.\n\nNow, in Example 0's third input array, the runs of six and seven are replaced. In the 13th array, a run of five is replaced. So the pattern seems to be: replace all consecutive sequences of five or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo, the rule is: in each array, look for consecutive runs of the same number. If the run length is five or more, replace each element in that run with a 4. Other elements remain the same.\n\nLet me confirm with another example. Take the third example in Example 0's input:\n\nInput array: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\n\nThe first run of 8s: six elements (positions 4-9) \u2192 replaced by six 4s. The run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) \u2192 seven 4s. So that fits.\n\nAnother example: the 17th input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [6,2,3,8,6,2,2,1,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nThe run of seven 1s (positions 10-16) \u2192 replaced by seven 4s. So yes.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to the test input. Let's take the test input arrays and process each, replacing runs of five or more same numbers with 4s.\n\nLet's start with the first test input array:\n\nTest Input 0: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nLooking for runs of five or more same numbers. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6,8,3,3,3: run of 3 threes (length 3)\n- Then 8 (single), 1 (single), 8 (single), 3 (single), 8,8 (length 2)\n- 1 (single), 6,3,1,2,3: all singles or shorter runs.\n- 1,1,1: run of three 1s.\n- 3 (single),1 (single),2,2 (length 2), etc. So no runs of five or more. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nNext test input array 1:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck runs:\n- 6,6 (length 2)\n- 8,8 (length 2)\n- 3,3 (length 2)\n- 8,8 (length 2)\n- 8,8,8 (length 3)\nNo runs of five. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nTest input array 2:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nCheck for runs:\nLooking at the sequence from index 21: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1. Wait, indexes 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So this is a run of six. Replace them with six 4s.\n\nSo the output array would have 4s in positions 21-26.\n\nSo the output for this array would be:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nTest input array 3:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n- 8,1: no\n- 2,2,2 (length 3)\n- 1,3,1: no\n- 1,1,3: no\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1,1: seven 1s starting at index 20. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nOutput for this array would have 4s from index 20 to 26.\n\nSo output array:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3]\n\nTest input array 4:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n- The run of 8s from index 4 to 15: let's count. Index 4 is 6, wait no. Let's recheck the array:\n\nThe array is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nWait, index 0:8,1:1, 2:2,3:3,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1, etc.\n\nSo the run of 8s starts at index 6 (value 8) and continues until index 15. Let's count:\n\nIndexes 6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8. That's 10 consecutive 8s (from index 6 to 15). So this run is length 10, which is >=5. Replace all with 4s.\n\nThen, after index 16, there's a run of seven 1s starting at index 20 (value 1, indexes 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo the output array will have 4s in positions 6-15 and 20-26.\n\nSo the output array becomes:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nWait, but index 4 is 8, index 5 is 6, then index 6 starts the run. So the 8s are from index 6 to 15 (10 elements). All replaced by 4s. Then the 1s from 20-26 (7 elements) replaced by 4s.\n\nTest input array 5:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of 8s from index 6 to 15: 10 elements. Replace with 4s.\n- Then, the run of 1s at indexes 20-24 (five 1s). Replace with five 4s.\n\nSo output array:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,2,8,3]\n\nTest input array 6:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The initial four 3s (indexes 0-3) are length 4, so no replacement.\n- Then 8 at index4, 3 at index5, followed by a run of 8s from index6 to 15: 10 elements. Replace with 4s.\n- Then, after index16, there's a run of 8s from index 22-27 (six elements). Replace with 4s.\n\nSo output array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,1,1,6,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3]\n\nTest input array 7:\n\n[3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of 8s from index6 to 15: 10 elements. Replace with 4s.\n- Then, a run of three 8s at indexes25-27 (if any), but looking at the input:\n\nAfter index15 is 8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8.\n\nThe run after index15 is: index16:8 (from input's array 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8])\n\nSo index6 is 8, and indexes 6-16: 8 (index6), 8 (7), 8 (8), 8 (9), 8 (10), 8 (11), 8 (12), 8 (13), 8 (14), 8 (15), 8 (16) \u2192 11 consecutive 8s. So indexes6-16 (11 elements) replaced by 4s.\n\nThen, indexes25-27: 8,8,8 (three elements) \u2192 no replacement.\n\nSo output array would have 4s from 6-16 (11 elements), and the rest as is.\n\nTest input array 8:\n\n[1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of 8s from index6 to 15: 10 elements. Replace with 4s.\n- Then, three 8s at indexes17-19 (8,8,8) \u2192 not replaced.\n\nOutput array:\n\n[1,8,3,2,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nTest input array 9:\n\n[8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of 8s from index6 to 15: 10 elements. Replace with 4s.\n- Then three 8s at indexes26-28 (8,8,8) \u2192 no replacement.\n\nOutput array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,1,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nTest input array 10:\n\n[3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of 8s from index5 to14: starting at index5 (8), and since the array is [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nIndexes5-15: 8s. So 11 elements (indexes5-15 inclusive). Replace with 4s.\n\nThen, a run of three 1s at indexes25-27 \u2192 no replacement.\n\nOutput array:\n\n[3,3,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nTest input array 11:\n\n[6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- There's a run of three 2s at indexes8-9 (2,2) \u2192 no.\n- At the end, three 2s (indexes27-29). Also, no runs of five. So no replacement. Output same as input.\n\nTest input array 12:\n\n[1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of 2s at indexes10-13 (four elements).

So that's four 3s, then a 6, then a 3. So no run of five.\n\nBut indexes16-20: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). Yes, a run of six. So indexes16-21 (assuming indexes start at 0):\n\nWait array elements from index16 to 21: 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six 3s. So replace with six 4s.\n\nSo output array:\n\n[...3,3,3,3,6,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nTest input array 20:\n\n[6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- The run of six 3s at indexes13-18 (3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3?
