        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples. Then, apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the training examples. Let's start with Example 0. The input and output arrays look similar in many places, but there are some changes. Let me compare them line by line.\n\nLooking at the third line of Example 0's input and output:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nI notice that in the input, there's a sequence of six 8s starting at index 4, which in the output are replaced by six 4s. Then, starting at index 20, there are seven 2s, which become seven 4s. So it looks like consecutive repeated numbers are being replaced with 4s. But how many repetitions trigger this?\n\nWait, let's check other lines. Take the fourth line of Example 0's input:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, from index 4, there are six 8s replaced by six 4s. Then from index 20, seven 2s become seven 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. But let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Take the third line of Example 1:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, starting at index 5, there are nine 6s, which are replaced by nine 4s. So the pattern seems to be replacing any consecutive sequence of 5 or more of the same number with 4s. Wait, wait, in the first example, six 8s were replaced. Let me check the exact counts.\n\nWait, in the third line of Example 0's input, the first replaced sequence is six 8s (indices 4-9). So 6 elements. Then the next sequence is seven 2s (indices 20-26), which is 7 elements. So the rule might be that runs of 6 or more identical numbers are replaced by 4s. Let's check other parts.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first two input lines. The first input line in Example 0:\n\nInput: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...]\nOutput is the same. So in the input, the first three 3s (indices 0-1?), but wait, 3,3, then 2, etc. So there's a pair of 3s. But in the output, it's unchanged. Then the 8,8,8 (three in a row) in the input becomes 8,8,8 in the output. So sequences shorter than 6 are left as is. So maybe the rule is: replace any consecutive sequence of exactly 6 or more same numbers with 4s. Let's see.\n\nWait in Example 0's third line, the first replaced sequence is six 8s (indices 4-9). The output shows six 4s. Then in the next part, indices 20-26 (seven 2s) become seven 4s. So any run of 6 or more same numbers is replaced by 4s for the entire run.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's third line, the nine 6s become nine 4s. So yes, the rule is: if there's a consecutive run of 6 or more same numbers, replace each element in that run with 4. Other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, check other parts. Let's look at another line in Example 0. The line starting with [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3] becomes [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]. Here, the input has seven 1s starting at index 10. These are replaced with seven 4s. So that's consistent.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input, the line starting with [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2] becomes [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]. Here, the seven 8s starting at index 13 are replaced by seven 4s. So yes, runs of 6 or more same numbers become 4s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each consecutive sequence of the same number in the input list, if the length of that sequence is 6 or more, replace each element in that sequence with 4. Otherwise, leave them as they are.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the Test Input lines. Let's check each line for runs of 6 or more same numbers.\n\nFirst line of Test Input:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nLooking for runs of 6. Let's see:\n\n- The 3,3,3 (three 3s) \u2014 too short.\n- 8,8 (two) \u2014 no.\n- 1,1,1 (three) \u2014 no.\nSo no runs of 6 here. So the output is the same as input.\n\nSecond line:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nCheck runs:\n- 8,8 (positions 3-4) \u2192 no.\n- 8,8 again (positions 10-11) \u2192 no.\n- 8,8,8 (positions 26-28) \u2192 three, no.\nNo runs of 6. So output same.\n\nThird line:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking at indices 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1. That's six 1s. So this should become six 4s.\n\nFourth line:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nCheck for runs. Starting at index 20: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth line:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nLooking for runs. From index 6 to 15: 8,6, then 8 followed by a bunch of 8s. Wait:\n\nWait, let's parse this correctly. The list is:\n\nIndices (assuming starting at 0):\n\n0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:8, 16:1, etc.\n\nFrom index 6 to 15: positions 6-15: that's 10 consecutive 8s. So this is a run of 10. Replace all with 4s.\n\nSixth line:\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\nCheck runs. From index 6 to 15: 8,8,... 8. How many? From index 6 to 15 inclusive is 10 elements. So 10 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nSeventh line:\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\nCheck for runs. The first four 3s: 3,3,3,3 (four elements). Then at index 4 is 8, followed by 3, then from index 6 to 15: 8,8,...8. Let's count. From index 6: 8, then index 7-15. That's 10 elements (indices 6-15: 10 numbers). So replace with 4s.\n\nEighth line:\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\nCheck runs. From index 6 to 16: 8,8,...8 (indices 6-16: 11 elements).
