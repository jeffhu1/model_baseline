        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output modifies some of those numbers. The key is to see how the input lists are transformed into the output lists.\n\nLet's start by comparing the first example's input and output. For instance, in Example 0, the input lists are modified in the output. Let's take the third input list in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, I notice that in the input, there's a sequence of multiple 8s (positions 4-9) and multiple 2s (positions 20-26). In the output, these sequences are replaced with 4s. The same pattern happens in other lists. For example, in the fourth input list of Example 0, there's a run of eight 8s starting at position 4, and those are replaced with 4s in the output. Similarly, in other lists, runs of the same number are replaced with 4s. But wait, not all runs. Let's check.\n\nAnother example: the second input in Example 1:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the sequence of 6s starting at position 5 (length 9) is replaced with 4s. So the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a consecutive sequence of the same number that's longer than a certain length, those are replaced with 4s. Let's check the lengths. The first example's third input had six 8s replaced with six 4s. The second example's third input had nine 6s replaced with nine 4s. Wait, in Example 0's third input, the 8s are from position 4 to 9 (6 elements), and the 2s from 20-26 (7 elements), both replaced with 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s for the entire run.\n\nWait, let's check more examples. In Example 0's fourth input:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere, there's a run of six 8s (positions 4-9) replaced by six 4s, and a run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) which are replaced by seven 4s, except the last element in that run (position 27) is 2 in input, but in output it's 2. Wait, no. Wait the input has 2s from 20 to 26 (7 elements), but the output has 4s from 20-26 and then position 27 is 2. Wait, original input's position 27 is 2 as well. Wait, the input's list for that fourth example has elements 20-26 as 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (seven 2s), but in the output, they are replaced by 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (seven 4s), and then the next element (position 27) is 2 in input and becomes 2 in output. So that's a run of seven 2s replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the pattern is that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire run. Let's check another example to confirm.\n\nIn Example 1's first input list:\n\nInput: [6, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2]\nOutput: same as input. Because there's a run of four 8s (positions 4-7), which is less than six, so it's not replaced. The run of 6s at positions 7-8 (two 6s) is not replaced. So only runs of 6 or more are replaced.\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's 12th input list:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nHere, the input has six 3s starting at position 22. So they are replaced with 4s. So the rule is: any consecutive run of exactly 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s. Wait, but in the first example, the third input had a run of six 8s replaced with six 4s. So the cutoff is 6.\n\nNow, the test input. Let's look at the third test input line:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, from position 20 (assuming 0-based index?), wait the list is written as [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Let's count the elements. Let's list the indices:\n\n0:8,1:8,2:3,3:6,4:3,5:1,6:6,7:8,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:3,12:1,13:2,14:8,15:1,16:8,17:2,18:1,19:3,20:2,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:8,28:3,29:6.\n\nSo positions 21-26 (elements 21 to 26) are seven 1s. So this is a run of 6 or more, so they should be replaced with 4s. So the output for this line would have 4s in those positions.\n\nAnother test input line:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The sequence at positions 20-26 (elements 1,1,1,1,1,1,1) is seven 1s. So replace them with 4s.\n\nAnother line in the test input:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, positions 6-15 (elements starting with 8,8,8,... up to 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8) which is a run of 10 8s. So these should all become 4s.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each consecutive sequence of the same number, if the length is 6 or more, replace all elements in that sequence with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each line in the test input and replace any runs of 6+ same numbers with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6 (1)\n- 8 (1)\n- 3,3,3 (3)\n- 8 (1)\n- 1 (1)\n- 8 (1)\n- 3 (1)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 1 (1)\n- 6 (1)\n- 3 (1)\n- 1 (1)\n- 2 (1)\n- 3 (1)\n- 1,1,1 (3)\n- 3 (1)\n- 1 (1)\n- 2,2 (2)\n- 6 (1)\n- 8 (1)\n- 2 (1)\n- 3 (1)\n- 8 (1)\n- 6 (1)\n\nNo runs of 6 here. So this line remains unchanged.\n\nNext test input line:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1 (1)\n- 6,6 (2)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 1 (1)\n- 3,3 (2)\n- 6 (1)\n- 3 (1)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 2 (1)\n- 1,1 (2)\n- 3 (1)\n- 6 (1)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 3 (1)\n- 1 (1)\n- 2 (1)\n- 1 (1)\n- 8 (1)\n- 2 (1)\n- 3 (1)\n- 8,8,8 (3)\n- 2 (1)\n\nNo runs of 6 here. So output same.\n\nThird test line:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. The 1s from positions 21-26 (assuming 0-based) are seven 1s. So replace these six (positions 21-26 inclusive is 6 elements? Let's count: 21,22,23,24,25,26: that's six 1s. Wait, the input is 2,1,1,1,1,1,1. So positions 21-26 (six elements) are all 1s. So this is a run of six, which should be replaced with 4s. So the output for this line would have 4s in positions 21-26. The next element is 8 (position 27), which is unchanged.\n\nFourth test line:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 1s from position 20-26 (seven elements). So this is a run of seven 1s, which should become 4s.\n\nFifth test line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 consecutive 8s. So replace all with 4s.\n\nSixth test line:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nHere, positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Ten 8s \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nSeventh test line:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nFirst four 3s (positions 0-3): run of 4 \u2192 unchanged. Then positions 4 is 8, then 3 (position5). Then positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then later, positions 22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nEighth test line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nHere, positions 6-16: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 \u2192 eleven 8s \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nNinth test line:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nPositions 6-15: eight 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.

Positions 0-2: three 8s. Positions 12-17: 3,3,3,3,6,3. Wait, no. Let's recheck:\n\nThe list is:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\n\nPositions 10-15: 3,3,3,3,6,3 \u2192 four 3s, then a 6 and a 3. So no run of 6. However, positions 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). So these should be replaced with 4s.\n\nSo in this line, positions 16-21 (six 3s) become 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nHere, positions 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second test line:\n\n[8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nPositions 16-22: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test line:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n\nPositions 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fourth test line:\n\n[1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\n\nPositions 16-22: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test line:\n\n[1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\n\nPositions 16-22: seven 3s \u2192 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth test line:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 5-8: 2,2,2,2 (four) \u2192 no. Positions 14-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (eight 3s) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nRuns: positions 0-1: two 3s. No other runs.\n\nTwenty-eighth test line:\n\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\n\nNo runs of 6.\n\nTwenty-ninth test line:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\n\nNo runs of 6.\n\nThirtieth test line:\n\n[8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\n\nNo runs of 6.\n\nSo applying this pattern to each line of the test input, replacing runs of 6 or more same numbers with 4s, and leaving others as-is.\n\nNow, I need to generate the output by processing each line of the test input, replacing runs of 6+ same numbers with 4s.\n\nLet me try to format the output correctly, using the same structure as the training examples. Each line in the output should be the transformed version of the corresponding test input line.\n\nFor example, the third test input line becomes:\n\nOriginal: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nThe run of six 1s (positions 21-26) becomes six 4s. So output line:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nWait, the positions are 21-26. Let's check the indices:\n\nIndices:\n\n0:8,1:8,2:3,3:6,4:3,5:1,6:6,7:8,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:3,12:1,13:2,14:8,15:1,16:8,17:2,18:1,19:3,20:2,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:8,28:3,29:6.\n\nWait, the 1s start at index 21 (element 21 is 1), and there are six 1s from 21 to 26 inclusive (indices 21-26). So replacing those six with 4s. So the output line will have 4s at indices 21-26.\n\nSimilarly for other lines."
