        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern here. Let's look at the training examples. The input and output arrays are mostly the same, but some elements are replaced with 4s. Let's compare the input and output of the first example.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output:\n\nIn the third input array (the third line of the input), the input starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The output replaces a sequence of 8s starting at position 4 (after the first four elements) with 4s. So the input's elements from index 4 to 9 (since Python is 0-based) are 8,8,8,8,8,8, which become 4,4,4,4,4,4. Then, the elements from index 20 to 26 (the 2s) are 2,2,2,2,2,2,2, which also become 4s. So in the output, those consecutive same numbers are replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, but how long do the consecutive numbers need to be? Let's check another example. In Example 0's fourth input line: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]. The output here has 4s from index 4 to 9 (the 8s) and from index 20 to 26 (the 2s). So again, sequences of 6 and 7 elements are replaced with 4s. But maybe the pattern is that any run of 6 or more identical numbers gets replaced with 4s for the entire run. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 0's fifth input line: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]. The output replaces the 8s (positions 4-9) and the 2s (positions 20-26) with 4s. The 3s in positions 12-13 (two 3s) aren't replaced. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for that entire run.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Take the third input array: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The output replaces the 6s starting at position 5 (indices 5-13, which is 9 elements) with 4s. That's a run of 9, which is longer than 6. The 6s in other parts of the array, like at positions 17-18 (two 6s), aren't replaced. So this supports the idea that runs of 6 or more are replaced.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's take the third line of the test input: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, the elements from index 21 to 26 are six 1s. According to the pattern, these should be replaced with 4s. Similarly, any other runs of 6 or more in the test input lines should be replaced.\n\nAnother example in the test input is the fourth line: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The sequence of 8s starts at index 6 and goes to 15 (positions 6-15 inclusive), which is 10 elements. So this entire run should be replaced with 4s.\n\nWait, but the output in the training examples replaces the entire run of 6+ with 4s. So the task is to find all consecutive sequences of the same number that are 6 or longer and replace each element in those sequences with 4.\n\nSo the transformation is: For each consecutive run of the same number, if the length is 6 or more, replace all elements in that run with 4. Otherwise, leave them as is.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each line of the test input and check for runs of 6 or more.\n\nFor example, the fourth test input line: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. Let's check the runs:\n\n- The first few elements: 8,1,2,3,8,6 \u2014 no runs here.\n- Then starting at index 6 (assuming 0-based), the value is 8, and the next elements are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6 to 15). That's 10 elements of 8. So replace all with 4.\n- Then 1,3,8 \u2014 no runs.\n- Then starting at index 19, there's 1 repeated 7 times (positions 19-25). Replace those 1s with 4.\n- The rest are individual numbers. So the output for this line would have 4s replacing those runs.\n\nSimilarly, the fifth test input line: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. Here, the 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 elements) become 4s. Also, the 1s at index 21-25 (5 elements) are only 5, so no replacement. Wait, the test input line has 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15 inclusive), which is 10 elements. So replaced with 4s. The 1s from 16-17 (1,1) \u2014 only 2. Then 3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1 (positions 20-25: 1s starting at 21?), let me check. The array is:\n\nIndices 0-5: 6,1,3,1,8,6\n\nIndices6-15: 8 (10 times)\n\nThen indices16-17: 1,1\n\nThen 3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1 (positions 18-25? Wait, original array is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. So after the 10 8s (indices6-15), the next elements are 1,1 (indices16-17), then 3 (18),1 (19),6 (20),1 (21),1 (22),1 (23),1 (24),1 (25). So from index21-25, that's five 1s. So that's a run of 5, which is less than 6, so not replaced. But then the next element is 6 (index26), etc. So only the 10 8s are replaced with 4s, and the two 1s at 16-17 are not. Also, the 1s at 19,21-25: index19 is 1, then 21-25 are five 1s. Wait, index21 is 1, 22,23,24,25. That's five 1s. So no replacement there. So in this line, only the 8s are replaced.\n\nAnother test line: the seventh input line [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8s from index6 to 16 (11 elements) would be replaced with 4s. Then the 1s at index17-18 (two 1s), not replaced. Then at the end, 8,8,8 (indices25-27?), which is three 8s, not replaced.\n\nSo the approach is: for each array in the test input, scan each element, track consecutive runs. Whenever a run of the same number reaches 6 or more, replace all elements in that run with 4.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each line of the test input. Since the test input is given as multiple arrays, each line is a separate array to process.\n\nFor example, the first test input line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6+ same numbers. Let's go through each element:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: run of 3\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: run of 2\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: run of 3\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: run of 2\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo runs of 6 or more here, so output is same as input.\n\nAnother test line: the third line of test input [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, the sequence starting at index21: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (indices21-26, 6 elements). So this should be replaced with 4s. The output would have 4s in those positions.\n\nAnother test line: the fourth line [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. The run of 1s starts at index20: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (positions 20-26: 7 elements). So replace those with 4s.\n\nThe fifth test input line: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The 8s from index6 to 15 (10 elements) become 4s. The 1s from index19 to 25 (7 elements) become 4s.\n\nSo for each line in the test input, I need to check all consecutive runs and replace those of length >=6 with 4s. Let's do this step by step for each test input line.\n\nNow, let's process each test input line.\n\nTest input line 0: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3,3,3 (3)\n- 8 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 1 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1,1,1 (3)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2,2 (2)\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n\nNo runs of 6+, so output is same as input.\n\nTest input line 1: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1 (single)\n- 6,6 (2)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 1 (single)\n- 3,3 (2)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 2 (single)\n- 1,1 (2)\n- 3 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8,8 (3)\n- 2 (single)\n\nNo runs of 6+, so output same as input.\n\nTest input line 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 3 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 1,1,1,1,1,1 (6 elements at indices21-26)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n\nThe run of six 1s at indices21-26 is replaced with 4s. So output line 2 will have 4s there.\n\nTest input line 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more.\n\nThe sequence of 1s starts at index20 (assuming 0-based): let's index the array:\n\nIndices 0:1, 1:3, 2:1, 3:2, 4:8, 5:1, 6:8,7:2,8:2,9:2,10:1,11:3,12:1,13:8,14:3,15:6,16:3,17:1,18:1,19:3,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:2,28:6,29:3.\n\nFrom index20 to 26: seven 1s. So this run of 7 is replaced with 4s.\n\nSo in the output, indices20-26 become seven 4s.\n\nTest input line4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking at the 8s from index6 to 15: indices6-15 inclusive (elements 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8) which is 10 elements. Replace with 4s.\n\nAlso, the 1s from index19-25: indices19-25 (elements 1,1,1,1,1,1,1) which is 7 elements. Replace with 4s.\n\nSo the output line will have 4s in those ranges.\n\nTest input line5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8s from index6 to15: 10 elements.

Replace those with 4s.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe array is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3].\n\nIndices6-15: 8s (elements 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8) \u2192 10 elements \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nThen indices22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 \u2192 6 elements \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the output will have 4s in those two regions.\n\nTest input line7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8s from index6 to16 (elements 6-16 inclusive: 11 elements) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nThen 8s at indices25-27 (3 elements) \u2192 not replaced.\n\nSo line7 output has 4s from6-16.\n\nTest input line8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8s from index6 to15: 10 elements \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nAlso, the 8s at indices17-19: 3 elements (8,8,8) \u2192 not replaced.\n\nTest input line9: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8s from index6 to15: 10 elements \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nThen 8,8,8 at indices26-28: 3 elements \u2192 not replaced.\n\nTest input line10: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8s from index5 to14: 10 elements (8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8) \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nThen 8s from index22 (after 2) to24:8 \u2192 single. The 1,1,1 at indices25-27: three 1s \u2192 not replaced.\n\nTest input line11: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nNo runs of 6. The longest is 2,2 (indices8-9), and 3,3 (indices20-21), but none reach 6. So output same as input.\n\nTest input line12: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 2s from index10-13: four 2s \u2192 no. The 3s from14-16: three \u2192 no. So no replacement. Output same.\n\nTest input line13: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]\n\nCheck runs: 6,6 at indices16-17 \u2192 two \u2192 no. No runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line14: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8,8 at start (two). Later, 3,3,3 at indices15-17 (three). Then 8,8,8 at indices18-20 (three). Then 3,3,3 at21-23 (three). No runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line15: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n3,3,3 at indices16-18 (three), 3,3,3 at20-22 (three). No runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line16: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n8,8,8 at indices21-23 (three). No runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line17: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]\n\nCheck runs: 8,8 at start (two). No others. Output same.\n\nTest input line18: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]\n\nCheck runs: No runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line19: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8,8,8 at start (three). Then 3,3,3,3,6: the 3s from index10-13: four. Then 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices15-20 (six elements). So this run of six 3s (indices15-20) is replaced with 4s.\n\nSo line19's output would have 4s from15-20.\n\nTest input line20: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s from index13-20: 3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 wait, wait the array is [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1].\n\nLooking at indices13-20:\n\n13:3,14:3,15:1,16:3,17:3,18:3,19:3,20:3 \u2192 no, the sequence is 3,3,1, followed by 3,3,3,3,3. So the run of 3s at 17-20: four 3s. Then at 20, 3. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me list the elements from 13 onwards:\n\n13:3,14:3,15:1,16:3,17:3,18:3,19:3,20:3,21:8.\n\nSo from 16 to20: five 3s. So no run of 6. So the only possible run is the 3s from16-20 (five). So no replacement. The 3s at indices13-14 (two). The 3s from16-20 (five). Not enough. So no replacement here. Then the 8,8,8 at indices23-25 (three). So output same.\n\nTest input line21: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s at indices16-22: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven elements). So replaced with 4s.\n\nTest input line22: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s at indices16-21: six elements (3,3,3,3,3,3). Replace with 4s.\n\nAlso, the 8,8,8 at indices10-12 (three) \u2192 no.\n\nTest input line23: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s at indices16-22: seven elements (3,3,3,3,3,3,3). Replace with 4s.\n\nTest input line24: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s at indices16-22: seven elements. Replace with 4s.\n\nAlso, the 3s at indices24-25: two \u2192 no.\n\nTest input line25: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s from indices13-20: eight elements (3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3). Replace with 4s.\n\nAlso, the 2s at indices5-8 (four 2s) \u2192 no.\n\nTest input line26: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 3s at indices9-11 (three), then 3s at13-17 (five). The 3s at13-17 are five \u2192 no. The 8,8 at0-1 \u2192 no. The 3s at9-11: three. So no runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line27: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n6,6 at start (two). 3,3,3 at indices2-4 (three). 3,3 at6-7 (two). 8,8,8,8 at8-11 (four). So no runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTest input line28: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n3,3,3,3 at indices6-9 (four) \u2192 no. Output same.\n\nTest input line29: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nThe 8,8 at indices7-8 (two) \u2192 no. 3,3,3 at28-30 (three) \u2192 no. No runs of 6. Output same.\n\nSo the final answer is to replace all runs of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s in the test input arrays. Now, applying that to each line and generating the output arrays."
