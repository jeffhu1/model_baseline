        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. The task is to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Let's start by looking closely at the examples to see if I can spot any obvious patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output lists are mostly the same, but some sections are replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0, the original input has a sequence of eight 8s starting at position 4. The output replaces those six 8s (positions 4 to 9) with 4s. Wait, actually, in the third input line of Example 0, the input is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...] and the output becomes [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,...]. So the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Hmm, but why six? The input here has six 8s in a row starting at index 4. Then in the output, they're replaced by 4s.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, those numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me check another example. Take the fourth input in Example 0: [1,3,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,...]. The output is [1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. Again, six 8s become six 4s. So it seems that consecutive runs of exactly six identical numbers are replaced by 4s. Wait, but in the third input of Example 0, there are six 8s (indices 4-9), which are replaced by six 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at the first training example (Example 1), the third input line is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,...]. The output replaces the run of nine 6s with 4s. Wait, in the output, it's [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So the run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. Hmm, that contradicts the initial thought of six. So maybe it's runs of six or more, not exactly six. Let's check other instances.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input line, the input is [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,...]. The output replaces the first six 8s (positions 4-9) with 4s. Wait, but there are seven 8s here (indices 4-10). The output shows [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,...]. So the first six 8s (positions 4-9) are replaced, leaving the seventh (index 10) as 8. That suggests that exactly six consecutive numbers are replaced, not more. Wait, but in the input, the 8s start at index 4 and go to index 10 (7 elements). But the output changes the first six (positions 4-9) to 4s, leaving the seventh (index 10) as 8. So the rule must be that runs of six or more are replaced, but only the first six in such runs? Or perhaps any run of exactly six is replaced, but longer runs have only the first six replaced?\n\nWait, let's look again. In Example 0's third input line, the input is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...]. That's six 8s (positions 4-9). The output is six 4s. In the seventh input line of Example 0, the input is [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,...], which has seven 8s (positions 4-10). The output replaces the first six with 4s and leaves the seventh as 8. So that suggests that whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, the first six are replaced by 4s, and any remaining numbers after the sixth stay as they are. Wait, but in the output, the seventh element in that run is 8. So the replacement is for the first six elements in any run of six or more. Let me verify with other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's third input line (the third line in the input of Example 1's INPUT), the input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,...], which is nine 6s. The output replaces all nine with 4s. Wait, no: the output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So all nine 6s are replaced by 4s. But that contradicts the earlier example where a run of seven 8s had the first six replaced and the seventh left. So maybe there's a different rule here. Wait, maybe it's not the first six, but any consecutive run of six or more, and the entire run is replaced with 4s regardless of length. But in the earlier example (Example 0's seventh input line), why was the seventh 8 not replaced? Let's check again.\n\nIn Example 0's seventh input line, the input is [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,...]. The output is [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,...]. So the first six 8s (positions 4-9) are replaced by 4s, and the seventh (position 10) remains 8. But that's a run of seven 8s. So why only the first six are replaced here, but in Example 1's third input line, all nine 6s are replaced. That inconsistency suggests maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look at the position where the run occurs. Let me check the training examples again carefully.\n\nWait, in Example 0's seventh input line: input is [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3]. The output line is [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]. Wait, the input here has a run of seven 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-10). The output replaces positions 4-9 (six elements) with 4s, leaving the 8 at index 10. Then, in the same output line, later there's a run of seven 3s starting at index 20 (positions 20-26), which in the input are 3s, but in the output, they're replaced by four 4s (wait, maybe I'm miscounting). Let me check the actual input and output for that line.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me look back. In Example 0's seventh input line (the one starting with [1,3,3,6...]), the input is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3]\n\nWait, no, the actual input is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3]\n\nWait, but the output is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nWait, the output has a run of six 4s (positions 4-9), then an 8 at position 10. Then later, starting at position 20 (assuming the list is 30 elements), the input has 8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3... but the output shows 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6. Wait, maybe in the output, there's another run of seven 3s that's replaced by seven 4s. Wait, perhaps the entire run of six or more is replaced, but in the first case, the input had a run of seven 8s and the output replaced six of them. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six, but when there's a longer run, the replacement is for the first six. But that's inconsistent with the Example 1 case where a run of nine 6s is replaced by nine 4s.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check another example. In Example 0's input, the third line's output is:\n\n[1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\n\nLooking at the input for that line, the input starts with [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...]. So there's a run of six 8s (positions 4-9). The output replaces them with six 4s. Then later in the input, starting at position 20 (assuming 0-based index), there's a run of seven 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So in that case, a run of seven 2s becomes seven 4s. That suggests that any run of six or more consecutive same numbers is replaced entirely with 4s. But why in the seventh input line of Example 0, the run of seven 8s is replaced with six 4s and one 8 remains? Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the seventh input line in Example 0's INPUT is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nWait, that's not possible. Wait, no, looking back, in Example 0's seventh input line (INPUT):\n\n[1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong line. Let me count again. The example 0's input has multiple lines. Let me clarify:\n\nIn Example 0's INPUT, the first line is the first input array, then the second line is the next input array, etc. The OUTPUT for Example 0 has the same number of lines. For the seventh line in the INPUT (assuming the first line is index 0), let's check:\n\nLooking at Example 0's INPUT:\n\nThe seventh line (index 7) is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nThe corresponding OUTPUT line is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nWait, the input here has a run of seven 8s starting at index 4 (positions 4-10). The output replaces the first six (indices 4-9) with 4s, leaving the seventh (index 10) as 8. Then later, in the same output line, starting at index 20, there's a run of seven 3s in the input? Wait, no. Let me check the input line again. The input line is:\n\n[1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nWait, positions 20-26 (assuming 0-based index) would be 20:8, 21:3, 22:8, 23:8, 24:3, 25:1, 26:6. That doesn't form a run. But the output line is [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]. So at position 20-26 in the output, there are 4s. Let's see: position 20 in the input is 8, then 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 6. How does that become 4s? It's possible that there's another run elsewhere. Maybe the input has a run of seven 3s somewhere else. Let me check the input line again.\n\nWait, the input line is [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]. So after position 20 (which is 8), we have 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 3. So the last two elements are 3,3. That's a run of two 3s. Not six. So maybe the output's run of seven 4s starting at position 20 is replacing a different part. Wait, maybe the input's elements 20 to 26 are [8,3,8,8,3,1,6], but the output's elements 20-26 are [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. That can't be a run of the same numbers in the input, so perhaps the replacement is not based on runs but on some other pattern. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a sequence of six or more of the same number, replace all of them with 4s. But in the seventh line's input, the seven 8s are replaced with six 4s and one 8. That doesn't fit. So perhaps my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that any group of six consecutive identical numbers is replaced by 4s, but if the group is longer than six, the remaining numbers are left as-is. So for a run of seven, the first six become 4s and the seventh stays. But in Example 1's third input line, there's a run of nine 6s which are all replaced by 4s. That would contradict that idea. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that every sixth element in the list is replaced with 4. But looking at Example 0's third line, the 4s start at index 4 (positions 4-9). If that's every sixth element, it doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that whenever there are six consecutive identical numbers starting from the fifth position (index 4) in the list, they are replaced with 4s. Let's check. In Example 0's third input line, the six 8s start at index 4. They are replaced. Similarly, in Example 0's fourth input line, the six 8s start at index 4. In Example 0's fifth input line, the six 8s start at index 4. So maybe the rule is that a run of six starting at index 4 is replaced by 4s. But in the seventh input line of Example 0, the run of seven 8s starts at index 4 (positions 4-10), so the first six (indices 4-9) are replaced. That would fit. Then in Example 1's third input line, the run of nine 6s starts at index 5. But in the output, they are all replaced by 4s, which would start at index 5. That would not fit the idea of starting at index 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the position where the run starts doesn't matter. Let's count how many runs of six or more are replaced with 4s in the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's output, the first two input lines have no 4s in the output. The third line has a run of six 4s starting at position 4, replacing six 8s. The fourth line similarly has six 4s starting at position 4, replacing six 8s. The fifth line same. Sixth line same. Seventh line: six 4s at positions 4-9, then in the same output line, there's a run of seven 4s starting at position 20. Wait, in the input line, what's at position 20-26? The input line is [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]. Positions 20-26 are 8,3,8,8,3,1,6. So that's not a run of the same number. So why are they replaced by 4s? That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a different pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is not based on consecutive numbers but on some other criteria. Let's consider the positions. For instance, in Example 0's third line, the six 4s are from positions 4-9. Similarly, in the fourth line, positions 4-9 are 4s. Fifth line same. Sixth line same. Seventh line positions 4-9 are 4s, and then positions 20-26 are 4s. But why? The input at 20-26 is 8,3,8,8,3,1,6. Not a run of same numbers. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lists are divided into groups of six elements, and if all elements in a group are the same, they are replaced by 4s. Let's check. For Example 0's third input line, positions 4-9 are six 8s. That's a group of six, so replaced by 4s. Then positions 20-25 (elements 20-25) in the input are 2,2,2,2,2,2 (from the input line [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]). So positions 20-25 are six 2s, replaced by six 4s. But in the output, it's [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is seven 4s. Wait, that's seven, but the input has seven 2s. So perhaps if a group of six is all the same, replace them, but also any consecutive group after that. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the 4s in the output and see what the corresponding input was. For every occurrence of a 4 in the output, what was the input value? In all examples, the 4s in the output replace sequences where the input had consecutive identical numbers. The value of the input numbers doesn't matter; it's the consecutive run length. So, whenever there's a run of six or more consecutive identical numbers, replace each element in that run with 4. But in some cases, longer runs are fully replaced. For example, in Example 1's third input line, nine 6s become nine 4s. But in Example 0's seventh input line, seven 8s become six 4s and one 8. That's a contradiction. So maybe the rule is that runs of exactly six are replaced, and longer runs are not. But in Example 1, a run of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the runs are replaced when they are exactly six. But in Example 1's third input line, there's a run of nine 6s, and all are replaced by 4s. So that would contradict the 'exactly six' idea.\n\nThis is perplexing. Let's try to find another pattern. Looking at the input and output pairs, the 4s appear in the output where there were consecutive repeats in the input, but the exact number varies. Maybe the position in the list matters. For example, starting at the fifth element (index 4), if there's a run of six, replace them. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 0's third line, the 4s start at index 4. Similarly, in the fourth line, fifth line, sixth line, and seventh line's first replacement. So perhaps any run of six starting at index 4 is replaced with 4s. But in the seventh line, the second replacement starts at index 20. Why index 20?\n\nWait, index 20 in a list of 30 elements is position 21st (if 0-based). That's way past the fifth element. So that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's count the positions where 4s appear in the output and see if there's a positional pattern. For instance, in Example 0's third output line, 4s are from positions 4-9 and 20-26. What's special about those positions? 4-9 is six elements, 20-26 is seven elements. Maybe every time there's a run of six or more, regardless of position, they are replaced with 4s. But why in some cases only part of the run is replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any run of exactly six is replaced with 4s. For longer runs, the entire run is replaced. For example, in Example 0's seventh input line, there's a run of seven 8s. According to the output, the first six are replaced with 4s and the seventh remains. But that doesn't fit with Example 1's third input line, where a run of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s. So this inconsistency suggests there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the runs must be exactly six, and if longer, they are not replaced. But that doesn't align with Example 1's third line. Let me check that again. In Example 1's third input line: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,...]. The output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. The run of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s. So that suggests that any run of six or more is replaced entirely with 4s, regardless of length. But then why in Example 0's seventh line, a run of seven 8s is replaced with six 4s and leaves one 8?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's look again:\n\nExample 0's seventh input line: [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nOutput line: [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nSo in the input, positions 4-10 are eight 8s (indices 4 to 10 inclusive, seven elements). The output replaces indices 4-9 (six elements) with 4s and leaves index 10 as 8. Then, later in the output, there's a run of seven 4s starting at index 20. Looking at the input for that part, indices 20-26 are [8,3,8,8,3,1,6]. These are not a run of the same number, but in the output, they are replaced by 4s. This doesn't make sense if the rule is based on runs. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the transformation is to replace every sixth occurrence of a number in the entire list with 4. But looking at Example 0's third line, the six 8s in positions 4-9 are replaced with 4s. The sixth occurrence would be the sixth 8, but they're all replaced. Alternatively, if every sixth element in the list is replaced, regardless of its value, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let's look at the Test Input. The Test Input has several lines. For example, the third line in the Test Input is:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nIn the input, the run of six 1s is from indices 20-25 (positions 20 to 25: six 1s). According to the pattern observed in the training examples, this run should be replaced with six 4s. So the output would have [...,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6].\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth line of the Test Input:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, there's a run of seven 1s from indices 20-26. According to the previous examples, this should be replaced with seven 4s.\n\nAnother Test Input line is the fifth line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, there's a run of ten 8s starting at index 4 (positions 4-13: 8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). Wait, no, the fifth line's input is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The run of 8s starts after the 6. Let's see: position 4 is 8, then 6 at position 5, then from position 6 to 15: eight 8s. So that's a run of eight 8s. According to the pattern, this entire run should be replaced with 4s. But how did the training examples handle longer runs?\n\nIn Example 0's seventh line, a run of seven 8s was replaced with six 4s and one 8. But in Example 1's third line, a run of nine 6s was replaced with nine 4s. So there's inconsistency. This is really puzzling.\n\nPerhaps the correct pattern is that any run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s, regardless of the length. So even if the run is longer than six, all elements are replaced with 4s. Then why in Example 0's seventh line, only six were replaced?\n\nWait, perhaps there was a mistake in my earlier analysis. Let me re-examine Example 0's seventh line. Input line: [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]. The output line: [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]. So in the input, the first run of 8s is seven elements long. The output replaces the first six with 4s and leaves the seventh. Then later, starting at index 20, the input has 8,3,8,8,3,1,6. The output here is seven 4s. That doesn't make sense if the replacement is based on runs of same numbers. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on consecutive numbers. Maybe it's something else. Let's think outside the box. Perhaps the pattern is that every group of six consecutive elements, regardless of their values, is replaced with 4s. But looking at the examples, that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace all occurrences of the number 8 with 4 in runs of six or more. But in Example 0's third line, 8s are replaced with 4s, but in other examples, 6s are replaced as well. For example, in Example 1's third line, 6s are replaced with 4s. So it's not specific to 8. So the replacement is for any number that has a run of six or more.\n\nSo the rule seems to be: in each list, any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length as the run.\n\nBut in Example 0's seventh line, a run of seven 8s is replaced with six 4s and one 8. That contradicts this. Unless I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace the first six elements of any run of six or more, and leave the rest as is. But in Example 1's third line, a run of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s, which doesn't fit. This is really confusing.\n\nWait, let's take a step back. Looking at the Test Input, the fifth line has a long run of 8s. For example, the fifth line's input is:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nIn this line, after the 6 at position 5, there's a run of nine 8s (positions 6-14). According to the training examples, this should be replaced with nine 4s. So the output would have 4s in positions 6-14.\n\nBut how did the training examples handle runs longer than six? In Example 1's third line, a run of nine 6s became nine 4s, so the entire run was replaced. That supports the idea that any run of six or more is fully replaced. But why in Example 0's seventh line, a run of seven 8s was only partially replaced?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the indices. Let's check Example 0's seventh line again:\n\nInput: [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nOutput: [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nWait, the input's run of 8s is from positions 4 to 10 (indices 4-10), which is seven elements. The output replaces positions 4-9 (six elements) with 4s, and position 10 remains 8. Then, later in the output, positions 20-26 are seven 4s. The input at those positions is [8,3,8,8,3,1,6]. That's not a run of the same number, so why are they replaced?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on consecutive numbers. Maybe it's something else entirely. For example, maybe every sixth element in the list is replaced with 4. But looking at Example 0's third line output, the 4s start at position 4 and are six in a row, which would mean positions 4-9. If every sixth element starting from position 4 is replaced, but that doesn't explain the six consecutive 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every occurrence of the sixth element in the list with 4. But the sixth element in Example 0's third input is 8, and the output's sixth element is 4. But the entire run is replaced.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to see if there's another pattern. For example, maybe the lists are being processed in chunks of six elements, and if all elements in a chunk are the same, replace them with 4s. Let's check Example 0's third input line: the first six elements are [1,8,3,1,8,8], which aren't all the same. The next six elements would be [8,8,8,8,1,3], which includes a 1 and 3. Not all the same. But positions 4-9 are six 8s, which is a chunk of six. So they are replaced. Then positions 20-25 are six 2s, replaced by 4s. But in the seventh input line, the chunk starting at position 4 is six 8s, replaced by 4s. The chunk starting at position 20 is [8,3,8,8,3,1], which is not all the same, but in the output it's replaced by 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe whenever there are six consecutive elements, regardless of their values, starting from position 4, they are replaced with 4s. So positions 4-9 in every list are replaced with 4s. Let's check the training examples. In Example 0, every output line has 4s in positions 4-9, except the first two lines, which don't have 4s. Wait, looking at Example 0's first input line's output: it's the same as the input. The first line's input doesn't have 4s in positions 4-9, so why are they not replaced? This suggests that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace positions 4-9 with 4s in every list. But in the training examples, some lines do not have 4s in those positions. For example, the first two input lines of Example 0's output are the same as the input. So this theory is incorrect.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's compare the input and output for each line in the training examples and see what's changing.\n\nExample 0, line 2 (third line):\n\nInput: [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,3]\n\nOutput: [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\n\nChanges: The 8s from positions 4-9 (six elements) are replaced with 4s. The 2s from positions 20-26 (seven elements) are replaced with seven 4s. So two separate runs are replaced.\n\nAnother line: Example 0, line 7 (the seventh line):\n\nInput: [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nOutput: [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nChanges: The first run of eight 8s (positions 4-10) is replaced by six 4s and one 8. Then later, positions 20-26 (input values 8,3,8,8,3,1,6) are replaced with seven 4s. But those input values are not a run of the same number, so this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the pattern is not based on consecutive numbers. Maybe it's something else. Let's think of the lists as being 30 elements long. The outputs have 4s in certain positions. Looking at the positions where 4s appear in the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0, line 2, 4s are at positions 4-9 and 20-26 (assuming 0-based). In line 3, 4s are at 4-9 and 20-26. Similarly, line 4, 5, etc. This suggests that the 4s are in two fixed blocks: positions 4-9 and 20-26, regardless of input values. But that's not the case. For example, in Example 0's line 8, the output has no 4s. So that theory is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the transformation is to replace the fifth to tenth elements (indices 4-9) and the twentieth to twenty-sixth elements (indices 19-25) with 4s, regardless of their values. Let's check Example 0's third line. The fifth to tenth elements (indices 4-9) are replaced with 4s. The twentieth to twenty-sixth elements (indices 19-25) in the input are [6,2,2,2,2,2,2], which are replaced with 4s. But in the output, the 4s are from indices 20-26, which are positions 20-26 (seven elements). So maybe the fixed positions are 4-9 and 20-26. But in Example 0's seventh line, positions 20-26 are replaced with 4s even though the input there is not a run of same numbers.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to replace elements at specific positions with 4s, regardless of their values. Let's check if this holds.\n\nLooking at Example 0's line 2 (third line):\n\nInput positions 4-9: [8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nInput positions 20-26: [2,2,2,2,2,2,2] \u2192 replaced with seven 4s.\n\nBut in Example 0's line 7 (seventh line), input positions 4-9 are [8,8,8,8,8,8] \u2192 replaced with 4s. Input positions 20-26 are [8,3,8,8,3,1,6] \u2192 replaced with 4s. So regardless of their values, these positions are replaced. This would explain the changes. But why are some lines not replaced? For example, the first two lines in Example 0's output are the same as input, so their positions 4-9 and 20-26 are not replaced. So this can't be the case.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the positions are replaced only if they contain a certain value, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let me try to see if there's another way. Let's look at the Test Input's third line:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nIn this line, there's a run of six 1s at positions 20-25. According to the pattern observed in the training examples, this should be replaced with six 4s. So the output for this line would have 4s in positions 20-25. Similarly, in the fourth line of the Test Input:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nHere, there's a run of seven 1s starting at position 20. So this would be replaced with seven 4s.\n\nBut according to some training examples, longer runs are replaced in their entirety, while in others, only six are replaced. This inconsistency makes it hard. However, given the Test Input's fifth line has a run of ten 8s, and if the rule is to replace runs of six or more with 4s, then the entire run should be replaced. So the output for that line would have ten 4s starting at position 6.\n\nPutting this together, the pattern seems to be that any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced with 4s for the entire length of the run. But why in Example 0's seventh line, a run of seven 8s is replaced with six 4s and one 8 remains?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the indexes. Let me check that line again:\n\nInput: [1,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,8,3,8,8,3,1,6,1,3,3]\n\nOutput: [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,2,8,2,8,2,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,6]\n\nThe run of 8s in the input is from index 4 to index 10 (positions 4-10 inclusive, seven elements). The output replaces indices 4-9 (six elements) with 4s, and index 10 remains 8. So the run is seven elements, but only the first six are replaced. Then, in the output, there's a run of seven 4s starting at index 20. The input there is [8,3,8,8,3,1,6], which are not the same. So this can't be explained by the run-length hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on consecutive elements. Perhaps there's another pattern, such as replacing every sixth element with 4, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves looking for sequences of six consecutive numbers, not necessarily the same, and replacing them with 4s. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: the problem may be that whenever there's a sequence of six 8s, they are replaced with 4s. But in Example 1's third line, 6s are replaced with 4s. So the number itself doesn't matter.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. The most plausible pattern based on the training examples is that any run of six or more consecutive identical numbers is replaced with 4s for the entire length of the run. For example, a run of six becomes six 4s, a run of seven becomes seven 4s, etc. However, in some training examples, this doesn't seem to hold, but perhaps those are exceptions or mistakes. Given the Test Input's third line has a run of six 1s, they should be replaced with six 4s. Similarly, the fifth line's long run of 8s should be replaced with 4s. \n\nApplying this rule to the Test Input:\n\nFor each line, identify runs of six or more consecutive identical numbers and replace each element in those runs with 4. Other elements remain the same.\n\nFor example, the third line of the Test Input:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nThe run of six 1s at positions 20-25 (indices 20-25) would become six 4s. The output for this line would have [...,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6].\n\nSimilarly, the fourth line:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nThe run of seven 1s from indices 20-26 would be replaced with seven 4s.\n\nThe fifth line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nThe run of nine 8s from indices 6-14 (assuming 0-based) would become nine 4s.\n\nThe sixth line:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe run of nine 8s from indices 6-14 would become nine 4s.\n\nThe seventh line:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nThe run of ten 8s from indices 6-15 would become ten 4s.\n\nThe eighth line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nThe run of eleven 8s from indices 6-16 would become eleven 4s.\n\nThe ninth line:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nThe run of ten 8s from indices 6-15 would become ten 4s.\n\nThe tenth line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\n\nThe run of nine 8s from indices 6-14 would become nine 4s.\n\nThe eleventh line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\n\nThe run of ten 8s from indices 6-15 would become ten 4s.\n\nAnd so on for other lines with runs of six or more.\n\nBased on this, the final answer for each Test Input line would be the same as the input, but with all runs of six or more consecutive identical numbers replaced by 4s of the same length."
