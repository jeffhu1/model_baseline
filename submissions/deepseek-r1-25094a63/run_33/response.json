        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output arrays are mostly the same except for some parts where numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me check the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input arrays have sequences of 8s and 2s that get replaced with 4s in the output. For instance, the third input array starts with [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,...], and the output has [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,...]. So, a run of six 8s becomes six 4s. Similarly, in the next array, there's a sequence of six 8s turned into 4s. \n\nWait, but how many 8s are needed to trigger the replacement? Let me check other parts. In the first example, the third input array's fifth to tenth elements are six 8s. They become 4s. Then, looking at another part of the same output, like the 20th to 26th elements: original is seven 2s, but in output, it's seven 4s. Wait, but in the output, that part is [1,3,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,1,...]. So maybe any consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the entire run?\n\nWait, let's check another example. In Example 1, the third input array has a sequence of nine 6s, and the output replaces them with 4s. The input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8...], and the output becomes [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8...]. So here, nine 6s become nine 4s. So the rule seems to be that any consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s for that entire run.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's first input array, there's a sequence of three 8s (elements 6,7,8) which becomes 8,8,8 in the output. So only when the run is six or longer. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn the first training example (Example 0), the third input array has 6 consecutive 8s (positions 5-10), which are replaced with 4s. Another example: the fourth input array in Example 0 has 6 8s in positions 5-10 again, replaced by 4s. So yes, the pattern is that whenever there's a run of six or more identical numbers, replace each of them with 4. For runs shorter than six, leave them as is.\n\nSo, the transformation is: for each consecutive sequence of the same number in the input array, if the length of the sequence is 6 or more, replace each element in that sequence with 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, let's check the test input and apply this pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input arrays:\n\nFirst test array: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nCheck for runs of 6 or more. Let's scan through:\n\n6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6.\n\nNo consecutive runs longer than 3 here. So no changes. So the output for the first array would be the same as input.\n\nSecond test array: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck for runs. Let's see:\n\n1,6,6 (length 2), 8,8 (length 2), 1,3,3 (length 2), 6,3,8,8 (length 2), etc. The longest run here is two. So no changes. Output same as input.\n\nThird test array: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The part from index 21 to 26 (assuming 0-based) is 1,1,1,1,1,1. That's six 1s. So replace with six 4s. So the output for this array would have those six 1s replaced with 4s.\n\nFourth test array: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. From index 20 to 26: seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nCheck the 8s starting at index 6 (value 8). From position 6 to 15: 8 repeated 10 times. That's a run longer than 6. Replace all with 4s. Then, after that, from index 19 to 25: seven 1s. Replace those with 4s. Also, the last element before the end is 8, which is a single, so no change. So in the output array, positions 6-15 (10 elements) become 4s, and positions 19-25 (7 elements) become 4s.\n\nSo applying this to each test input array, wherever there's a consecutive sequence of six or more same numbers, replace with 4s for the entire run. The rest stay the same.\n\nNow, let's process each test input array one by one.\n\nTest Input 0: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nNo runs of six, so output same.\n\nTest Input 1: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nNo runs of six, output same.\n\nTest Input 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nThe six 1s at positions 21-26 (assuming 0-based, elements 21-26 are 1,1,1,1,1,1) become six 4s.\n\nTest Input 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nThe seven 1s starting at index 20 (elements 20-26: seven 1s) become seven 4s.\n\nTest Input 4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nFrom index 6 to 15 (elements 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8) \u2192 10 8s \u2192 replace with 10 4s. Then, from index 19-25 (seven 1s) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nTest Input 5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nFrom index 6 to 15 (elements 8 repeated 10 times) \u2192 replace with 4s. Then, elements 21-25 (five 1s) not enough. Wait, elements 21-25: 1,1,1,1,1 (five 1s), so no. But in the input array, after the 8s, the next part is 1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3. So the run of 1s from index 21 (if 0-based) is five 1s. So no replacement there. Wait, the original array is [6,1,3,1,8,6, followed by 10 8s (indices 6-15), then 1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The run of 1s after that is five, which is less than six. So only the 10 8s are replaced with 4s. The output for this array would have the 8s replaced.\n\nTest Input 6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nThe run of eight 8s starting at index 6 (after the first few elements) would be replaced. Let's see the array: elements 4 is 8, then index 5 is 3, then index 6 is 8, but wait, the array is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. So from index 6 to 15: 8 repeated 10 times. So replace those with 4s. Then, from index 22 to 27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six times) \u2192 replaced with 4s. So the output would have two replaced regions.\n\nTest Input 7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nThe 8s starting at index 6: from 6 to 15, which is 10 8s. Then another 8 at 16 (since index 16 is 8). So total 11 8s. So replace all 11 with 4s. Then, after that, there's a run of 3 8s at index 25-27 (8,8,8). Not enough. So only the first 11 8s become 4s.\n\nTest Input 8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nThe run of 8s from index 6 to 15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then three 8s at 17-19 (assuming the array is [...,8,8,8,2,...]). Three 8s, so no replacement.\n\nTest Input 9: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15: ten 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then three 8s at the end (positions 26-28?), so no.\n\nTest Input 10: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nThe 8s from index 5 to 14: ten 8s \u2192 replace with 4s. Then from index 15, it's 8 again (since the array is [3,3,1,1,2,8,...,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3...]. Wait, the run starts at index 5 (element 8) and continues. Let's count: from 5 to 14 is ten elements. Then index 15 is also 8. So total 11 8s. Replace all with 4s. Then after that, the 3 comes in. Also, the three 1s at positions 25-27 (1,1,1) \u2192 three, no replacement.\n\nTest Input 11: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nLooking for runs. The 2s at the end (positions 27-29: three 2s). No runs of six. So output same as input.\n\nTest Input 12: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nCheck for runs. The 8,8 at index 6-7 (two 8s). Then the 2,2,2,2 at index 10-13 (four 2s). The 3,3,3 at 14-16 (three 3s). Then later, two 1s. No runs of six. So output same.\n\nTest Input 13: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]\n\nNo runs of six. Output same.\n\nTest Input 14: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8,8 at start (two), then 1,1 (two), 2,1 (no), etc. The 3,3,3 at 16-18 (three), then three 8s, then three 3s. No runs of six. Output same.\n\nTest Input 15: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\n\nThe 3,3,3,6 at positions 16-19? Wait, the array is [...,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,...]. So from index 16 (assuming 0-based), there's 3,3,3,6. Three 3s. Then later 3,3,3. So no runs of six. Output same.\n\nTest Input 16: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8,8,8 at index 21-23 (three). Then 1,1. No. The 6,6,8,6...? No. Output same.\n\nTest Input 17: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]\n\nTwo 8s at start. Then later three 3s, two 8s, etc. No runs of six. Output same.\n\nTest Input 18: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]\n\nNo runs of six. Output same.\n\nTest Input 19: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8,8,8 at start (three). Then 3,3,3,3,6: four 3s. Then 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) from index 10-15? Let me check: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. The 3s at index 10-15: 3,3,3,3,6 (no, the sixth element here is 6). Wait, index 10:3, 11:3, 12:3, 13:3, 14:6. So only four 3s. Then after 6, there's 3,3,3,3,3,3 (indices 15-20: six 3s). So that's a run of six 3s. Replace them with 4s. Also, the three 8s at the start (indices 0-2) are three, so no. The 3s at 15-20: six 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input 20: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\n\nThe 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices 15-20: six 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Also, the 8s at indices 24-26: three 8s.

The 3s from indices 16-21: six 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Also, three 8s at 10-12: replaced? No, since only three. So output for this array would have the six 3s as 4s.\n\nTest Input 23: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nThe 3s from indices 16-22: seven 3s \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nTest Input 24: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n\nThe 3s from indices 15-21: seven 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then another 3,3,8, etc. So that run becomes 4s.\n\nTest Input 25: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n\nThe 3s from indices 13-20: eight 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest Input 26: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 3s from indices 8-12 (assuming array is [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]). The 3,3,3 at 7-9 (three 3s). Then later, from index 13-17: five 3s (maybe index 13 is 3, 14-17: 3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 five). So no. Then after that, 6,8,8, etc. So no runs of six.\n\nWait, let's recheck. Original array for test input 26:\n\n[3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs. The 3,3 at the start (two), then 1,1,1 (three). Then 8,8 (two), then 3,3,3 (three). Then a 2, then 8, then 2. Then 3,3,3,3,3 (five) starting at index 13. Then 6, 8,8, etc. The five 3s are not six, so no replacement. So output same.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the test input 26 again:\n\n[3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nThe part after index 13: 3,3,3,3,3 (positions 13-17: five 3s). So no replacement. So this array would stay the same.\n\nTest Input 27: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\n\nNo runs of six. The 8,8,8,8 (four) \u2192 no. The 3,3,3 (three) \u2192 no. So output same.\n\nTest Input 28: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\n\nThe 3,3,3,3 at indices 6-9 (four 3s) \u2192 no replacement.\n\nTest Input 29: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n\nNo runs of six. So output same.\n\nSo applying this to each of the test input arrays and replacing runs of six or more same numbers with 4s. Now, let's write the output arrays accordingly."
