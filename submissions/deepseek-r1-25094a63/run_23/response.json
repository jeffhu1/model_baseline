        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, each input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list. The first thing I notice is that in some of the output examples, certain sequences of numbers are replaced with the number 4. Let's look at Example 0's input and output.\n\nIn Example 0's first input line, the output is the same as the input. But starting from the third input line in the first example, there's a part where a series of 8s in the input becomes a series of 4s in the output. For instance, the third input line has [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...], and the output changes the six 8s starting at position 4 to six 4s. Similarly, other lines in the example have runs of 8s replaced by 4s. Wait, but in the fourth line of the first example's input, the input has eight 8s starting at position 4, but the output replaces them with six 4s. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe it's not just 8s. Let me check another example. In the third line of Example 0's input: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, ...], the output has [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3, 8,...]. Oh, so the six 8s are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, in the next line, there's a run of eight 8s in the input, but in the output, they become six 4s again. Wait, but how long are the runs being replaced? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first example's third input line: the input starts with 1,8,3,1, then eight 8s. The output shows six 4s starting at position 4. Wait, the input here from index 4 to 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing?) Let me count. The input is [1,8,3,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,...]. So from the fifth element (index 4 if 0-based) there are six 8s. The output replaces those six 8s with six 4s. Similarly, in the fourth input line of Example 0: [1,3,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2...], the output has 4s in those positions. So it's replacing sequences of six 8s with six 4s. Wait, but what if the run is longer than six? Let's see in the fifth input line of Example 0's input: [3,3,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3...], which in the output becomes [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3...]. Again, six 8s replaced with six 4s. But what if there are more than six? For example, in the third input line of Example 0's input, there are six 8s. So maybe the rule is: any consecutive run of exactly six 8s is replaced with six 4s. Or maybe runs of 6 of any number, but looking at the examples, maybe it's 8s.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's third input line: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8...] and the output becomes [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8...]. Here, the input has nine 6s starting at position 5 (0-based?), but the output replaces them with nine 4s. Wait, but in the training example, the output here has 4s for a run of nine 6s. So maybe the rule is different. Hmm. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 1's third input line, the input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8...] and the output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8...]. So nine 6s become nine 4s. So the number of consecutive digits being replaced isn't fixed. Then maybe the rule is that whenever there are six or more consecutive same digits, they are replaced with the same number of 4s. Or maybe it's when there are exactly six, but this example has nine. So that's conflicting with the earlier examples.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that whenever there's a run of six or more of the same number, it's replaced with 4s. Let's check. In Example 0's third input line, there's a run of six 8s, replaced by six 4s. In Example 1's third input line, a run of nine 6s becomes nine 4s. So perhaps the pattern is: any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s for the entire run. But why 4? Maybe the 4 is a fixed replacement, regardless of the original number.\n\nWait, in Example 0's first test case, the input lines that don't have long runs (like the first two) are unchanged. The third line has a run of six 8s, which becomes 4s. The fourth line has six 8s, same. The fifth line also six 8s. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input line 18: [2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...]. The output is [2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1, 1, 1, ...]. Here, the input has ten 1s starting at index 10. The output replaces the first seven with four 4s? Wait, the input is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is ten 1s. The output in that line is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1]. Wait, that's seven 4s followed by three 1s. So how does that fit? Maybe the replacement starts when the run is at least six, but the entire run is replaced. Wait, in this example, the run is ten 1s. The output shows seven 4s followed by three 1s. Wait, that's inconsistent. Unless maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly seven? Or perhaps the replacement is for runs of six or more, but only a certain part of them. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is that the first occurrence of a run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s. Let me check another example. Take Example 0's line 17: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, ...]. The output is [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,...]. The input here has seven 1s starting at index 10. The output replaces them with seven 4s. So that's a run of seven 1s replaced by seven 4s.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: wherever there's a consecutive run of six or more of the same number, replace each element in that run with a 4. So the number of 4s equals the length of the original run. The other numbers remain the same.\n\nSo the transformation is: in the input list, for any consecutive sequence of six or more identical digits, replace each digit in that sequence with 4. All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nLet me verify this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 0, the third input line has six 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9, 0-based). The output replaces them with six 4s. That fits. The fourth input line has six 8s in the same positions, replaced by 4s. Then line 17 has seven 1s replaced by seven 4s. In Example 1's third line, nine 6s become nine 4s. That fits.\n\nSo the rule is: any consecutive run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s, maintaining the same length of the run. All other numbers are left as is.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's look for any runs of six or more identical numbers. Let's check each line of the test input:\n\nTest input lines:\n\n1. [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n   Looking for runs of 6 same numbers. Let's see: the 3,3,3 at the start is only three. Then 8,3,8,8: not a run. The 1,1,1 is three. So no runs of 6 here. So this line remains unchanged.\n\n2. [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n   Check runs: 6,6 (two), 8,8 (two), 3,3 (two). The three 8s at the end (positions 26-28) is three, so no. So no runs of 6. Unchanged.\n\n3. [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n   Here, from position 21 to 26 (assuming 0-based), we have six 1s: 1,1,1,1,1,1. So this run of six 1s should be replaced by six 4s.\n\n4. [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n   From position 20 to 26: seven 1s. So replaced by seven 4s.\n\n5.

[8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n    Three 3s at the end. No.\n\nSo for each line in the test input, we need to check for consecutive runs of six or more of the same number and replace each with 4. Let's apply this to each line.\n\nNow, let's process each test input line:\n\nLine 3: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n   The six 1s (positions 21-26) become six 4s. So output starts as the same list, but from index 21-26 (assuming 0-based) replace each 1 with 4.\n\nLine 4: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n   Seven 1s from positions 20-26. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nLine 5: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n   Ten 8s from positions 6-15. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nLine 6: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n   Ten 8s from positions 6-15. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nLine 7: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n   Eight 8s from positions 7-14. Replace with eight 4s.\n\nLine 8: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n   Ten 8s from positions 6-15. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nLine 9: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n   Ten 8s from positions 6-15. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nLine 10: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n   Ten 8s from positions 6-15. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nLine 11: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n   Ten 8s from positions 5-14. Replace with ten 4s.\n\nLine 20: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n   Six 3s from positions 12-17. Replace with six 4s.\n\nLine 21: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\n   Six 3s from positions 16-21. Replace with six 4s.\n\nLine 22: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\n   Seven 3s from positions 16-22. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nLine 23: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\n   Six 3s from positions 16-21. Replace with six 4s.\n\nLine 24: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n   Seven 3s from positions 16-22. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nLine 25: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n   Seven 3s from positions 16-22. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nLine 26: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n   Seven 3s from positions 14-20. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo for each of these lines in the test input, wherever there is a run of six or more identical numbers, replace each element in that run with 4. The other lines remain unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this to each line of the test input and generating the output accordingly."
