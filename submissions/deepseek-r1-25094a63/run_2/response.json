        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see here. I need to figure out the pattern between the input and output in the training examples so I can apply it to the test input. Let me start by looking at the first example. \n\nIn Example 0, the input is a list of numbers, and the output is similar but some parts are replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0, the input starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...] and the output becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...]. So the consecutive 8s are replaced with 4s. Let me check another array. The fourth input array has [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...] which in output becomes [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...]. Again, the six 8s are replaced by six 4s. But wait, some other arrays in the same example don't have 4s. Like the first array in Example 0's input and output are identical. So maybe the rule is that consecutive numbers of a certain length are replaced by 4s.\n\nLooking at the second example, Example 1, the same pattern seems to hold. For instance, in the third input array of Example 1's input, there's a sequence of 6s: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, ...] which in the output becomes [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, ...]. So here, a sequence of nine 6s is replaced by nine 4s. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the consecutive 8s were replaced by 4s. In the second example, consecutive 6s. So maybe the pattern is that any run of six or more of the same number is replaced by 4s. Let me check the first example again. The third input array in Example 0 has eight 8s, which are replaced by six 4s. Wait, no, the input part is [8,8,8,8,8,8], which is six 8s. So in the output, that becomes six 4s. So the replacement occurs when there's a run of exactly six of the same number? Or six or more? Let's see. \n\nLooking at another part in Example 0's input: the third array has eight 8s. Wait, no, looking at the third input array in Example 0's input: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. So the sixth to eleventh elements are 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), which in the output are replaced by six 4s. Then in the same array, the elements 21-27 (indices 20 to 26) are seven 2s, which in the output become seven 4s. So that's a run of seven, which is replaced by 4s. So the rule seems to be that any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length. \n\nWait, let me confirm. In Example 0's third input array, the first part is six 8s replaced by six 4s, and then seven 2s replaced by seven 4s. So the rule is: if there's a sequence of six or more identical numbers, replace each element in that sequence with 4. The length of the sequence remains the same. So the replacement is for runs of 6 or more. \n\nNow, looking at the first input array in Example 0: the input and output are the same. Let's see why. The input array is [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]. Are there any runs of 6 or more? Let's check. The 3s in positions 10-14 (0-based indexing) are five 3s (indices 10-14: 3,3,3,3,3), so that's five. So no replacement. The 8s are three, then two, etc. So no runs of six. Hence, no replacement. \n\nAnother example in Example 0's input: the fifth array in input starts with [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...]. The 8s from index 4 to 9 (six 8s) are replaced by six 4s. So that fits. \n\nIn Example 1, the third input array is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The output replaces the nine 6s with nine 4s. \n\nSo the pattern seems clear: in the input arrays, wherever there is a consecutive run of six or more identical numbers, replace each of those elements with 4. The rest of the numbers remain the same. \n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at each array in the test input and find runs of six or more same numbers, then replace them with 4s of the same length. \n\nLet's take the first test input array: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. Scanning through, there's a sequence of three 3s, then three 8s, etc. No run of six, so the output is the same as input. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check each array in the test input. \n\nTest input has 30 arrays. Let's check the third array in the test input: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. Looking at the elements from index 20 to 26 (0-based): 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So this is a run of seven 1s. According to the pattern, these should be replaced by seven 4s. So the output array would have 4s in those positions. \n\nAnother example: the fifth test input array is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. Looking at the 8s: starting at index 6 (element 8) and continuing to index 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). So this is a run of 10 8s. So replace all ten with 4s. \n\nAnother test array: the seventh input is [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8s from index 6 to 16: 8 repeated 11 times. Replace with 4s. \n\nSo the strategy is: for each array in the test input, scan for consecutive runs of the same number that are 6 or longer. Replace each element in those runs with 4. \n\nNow, I need to process each array in the test input, check for runs of 6+ same numbers, and replace them with 4s. Let's do this step by step.\n\nLet me take the first test array:\n\nTest input array 0: [6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]. Check each element. The runs here are 3,3,3 (three 3s), 8,8 (two 8s), etc. No runs of 6. So output is same as input.\n\nSecond test array: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. Check for runs. The 6s at positions 1-2 (two 6s), 8s at 3-4 (two), 3s at 6-7 (two), 8s at 10-11 (two), etc. The 8s at positions 25-27 (three). So no runs of 6. Output same.\n\nThird test array: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, starting at index 20: elements 20-25 are 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace these six 1s with 4s. So the output array here would have [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6].\n\nFourth test array: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. The run from index 20 to 26 is seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s. So elements 20-26 become 4,4,4,4,4,4,4. The output array would have [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3].\n\nFifth test array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The 8s from index 6 to 15: 10 8s. Replace with 10 4s. The 1s at index 19-25 are seven 1s. Replace those seven with 4s. So the output array becomes [8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8].\n\nWait, but the 8s at index 6-15 (inclusive) are 10 elements (indices 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). So replaced by ten 4s. Then the 1s at index 19-25 (elements 19 is 1, 20-25 are 1,1,1,1,1,1,1\u2014 seven 1s). So those become 4s. So the output array would have:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]. Wait, wait. Let me recheck. The original array is:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nThe first run starts at index 6 (element 8), which is the seventh element (0-based index 6). So elements 6 to 15: that's 10 elements (indices 6-15 inclusive). So replaced with 4s. Then, elements 19 is 1, and elements 20-26 (since there are seven 1s) are indices 20-26. So indices 19-26? Wait, original array's 20-26: let's count. The array is:\n\nIndices:\n\n0:8\n\n1:1\n\n2:2\n\n3:3\n\n4:8\n\n5:6\n\n6:8\n\n7:8\n\n8:8\n\n9:8\n\n10:8\n\n11:8\n\n12:8\n\n13:8\n\n14:8\n\n15:8\n\n16:1\n\n17:3\n\n18:8\n\n19:1\n\n20:1\n\n21:1\n\n22:1\n\n23:1\n\n24:1\n\n25:1\n\n26:8\n\nSo the 1s start at index 19 (value 1), then indices 20-25 are 1s. That's seven 1s (indices 19-25 inclusive: 7 elements). So those seven 1s are replaced by 4s. So the output array for this would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8].\n\nYes. \n\nProceeding like this for each array. The key is to find runs of six or more same numbers and replace each with 4. The rest remain the same. \n\nLet me look at another test array. The sixth test input array: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. Here, the 8s from index 6 to 15 (ten 8s) are replaced by 4s. The 1s from index 20-25 (six 1s) are replaced by 4s. So output becomes:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,2,8,3].\n\nAnother test array: the seventh input is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. The first four elements are four 3s (so not replaced). Then at index 4:8, followed by 3, then 8s from index 5 (element 3) to 15 (element 8): wait, no. Let me recheck the array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3].\n\nIndex 0-3: four 3s. Then index 4:8, index 5:3. Then from index 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). So replace those ten 8s with 4s. Then the 8s from index 22 to 27: six 8s (indices 22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8). Replace those with 4s. So output array becomes:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,1,1,6,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3].\n\nAnother test array: the eighth input is [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8s from index 6 to 16: 11 elements (indices 6-16 inclusive) are 8s. Replace with 4s. Then the 8s at index 25-27 (three 8s) are not long enough. So output becomes:\n\n[3,3,1,3,2,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8].\n\nContinuing this process for all arrays in the test input. The key is to scan each array, identify runs of six or more same numbers, replace each element in those runs with 4. \n\nNow, to format the answer correctly, each output array should be in the same format as the training examples. Each array is on a separate line, enclosed in square brackets, elements separated by commas. \n\nSo the final answer will consist of 30 arrays, each modified according to the pattern found."
