        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output arrays are mostly the same except some numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me compare the input and output for each example.\n\nTake Example 0: In the third input array, there's a sequence of eight 8s starting at index 4. The output replaces those with six 4s. Wait, no, looking closer, the input has [8,8,8,8,8,8] (six 8s) and the output changes them to [4,4,4,4,4,4]. So that's six elements replaced by 4s.\n\nWait, let me check another part. The first input array in Example 0's input doesn't have any 4s in the output. So maybe only certain sequences are replaced. Let's look for when a group of consecutive same numbers is replaced by 4s. Hmm.\n\nLooking at another example: In Example 0's third input array, after the first few elements, there's a long run of 2s. The output replaces those with 4s. Let me count. The input has [2,2,2,2,2,2,2], which is seven 2s starting at index 20. The output is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], same count but replaced by 4s. So maybe consecutive numbers of a certain length are replaced by 4s.\n\nWait, but how long do the consecutive numbers have to be? Let's check another part. In Example 0's fourth input array, there's a run of eight 8s. The output replaces them with six 4s. Wait, no: the input has [8,8,8,8,8,8] (six elements) at positions 4-9, and the output is [4,4,4,4,4,4]. So maybe when there are six or more consecutive same numbers, they get replaced with 4s. Let's verify.\n\nIn Example 0's first input array, the input has [8,8,8] (three 8s) at indices 5-7, and they remain 8s in the output. So that's less than six. Another example: in the second training example (Example 1), the third input array has a run of nine 6s. The output replaces them with 4s. Wait, the input is [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6] (nine 6s) starting at index 5. The output becomes seven 4s. Wait, no, the output shows [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4], which is nine 4s. So maybe any consecutive run of the same number, regardless of length, as long as it's six or more, is replaced by 4s. Wait, but in Example 0's third input, the run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. So maybe whenever there's a consecutive run of exactly six or more, they are replaced by the same number of 4s.\n\nWait, let's check another example. In Example 1's input, the third array has a run of nine 6s, which are replaced by nine 4s. So it seems like any consecutive sequence of six or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. Let's confirm with more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 0's eighth input array (index 8 in the input list), the input has [3,8,1,3,1,8,1,3,1,2,3,1,8,6,2,1,3,1,1,8,3,1,6,3]. The output is the same. So no replacement here. That's probably because there are no consecutive runs of six or more same numbers.\n\nAnother example: in Example 0's input array at index 12 (the 13th array), the input has [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]. The output replaces the six 3s starting at position 22 with [4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, original input has 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) and the output is 4,4,4,4,4, which is five 4s? Wait, that can't be. Let me check the exact positions. Wait, the input array is:\n\n[8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,8,1]\n\nLooking at the elements starting at index 22 (assuming 0-based index), let's see:\n\nIndices 22-27: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output is [4,4,4,4,4,4], replacing all six with 4s. So that's correct. So any run of six or more same numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input, the third array (index 2) is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. The consecutive 6s are from index 5 to 13 (nine elements), and the output replaces them with nine 4s. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each array, any consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number is replaced with the same number of 4s. All other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each array in the test input and look for consecutive runs of six or more same numbers, replacing them with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n\n[6,8,3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,6,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,6,8,2,3,8,6]\n\nLooking for any runs of six or more. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3,3,3 (three in a row)\n- 8 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8 (two)\n- 1 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1,1,1 (three)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2,2 (two)\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n\nNo runs of six or more, so no changes. So the output array remains the same.\n\nNext test array:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 1 (single)\n- 6,6 (two)\n- 8,8 (two)\n- 1 (single)\n- 3,3 (two)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8 (two)\n- 2 (single)\n- 1,1 (two)\n- 3 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 8,8 (two)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8,8 (three)\n- 2 (single)\n\nNo runs of six. So no changes.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's see:\n\nAt index 20 (assuming 0-based), we have 2, then from index 21: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So that's a run of six. Replace these six 1s with six 4s.\n\nSo the output array will have 4s from index 21 to 26.\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. The elements from index 20 to 26 are seven 1s. So replace them with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nCheck the runs:\n\nAt index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (nine 8s). That's a run of nine. Replace with nine 4s.\n\nAlso, from index 19: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo both these runs are replaced.\n\nSixth test array:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nFrom index 6 to 15: eight 8s. Replace with eight 4s.\n\nIndex 21 to 25: five 1s (not enough). But index 17-18: two 1s. So only the eight 8s are replaced.\n\nWait, the array is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nIndices 6-15 (assuming 0-based):\n\nIndex 6: 8\n\nIndices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). Wait, wait, wait. Let me count again. The elements starting at index 6 are eight 8s? Let's see:\n\nOriginal array elements from index 6 onward: 8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Wait, no. Wait the array is:\n\nPositions 0-5: [6,1,3,1,8,6]\n\nThen position 6: 8\n\nThen 7-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 7-16? Wait, the array has 30 elements. Let me recount:\n\nThe array is:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nSo from index 6 to 15 (positions 6-15 inclusive) that's ten elements: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Ten 8s. So replace with ten 4s.\n\nThen, the next run: at index 21 (element 1), we have 1,1,1,1,1 (five 1s). Not enough. So only the ten 8s are replaced.\n\nSeventh test array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nFirst four 3s: 3,3,3,3 (four). Then at index 4:8, then 3, then from index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6-15: ten 8s). Replace those ten with 4s. Also, from index 22: eight 8s (positions 22-29?), wait let's check:\n\nAfter the 1,3,1,1,6,2, the next elements are 8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3. So positions 22-27: six 8s. That's six, so replace with six 4s.\n\nSo in this array, two runs: ten 8s (indices 6-15) replaced by ten 4s, and six 8s (indices 22-27) replaced by six 4s.\n\nEighth test array:\n\n[3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The array has a run of eleven 8s starting at index 6 (positions 6-16 inclusive: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). Replace with eleven 4s.\n\nThen, from index 25: three 8s. Not enough. So only the eleven 8s are replaced.\n\nNinth test array:\n\n[1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nRun of 8s from index 6 to 15: ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Then another three 8s at 17-19: replaced with 4s? Wait, index 17-19: 8,8,8 (three 8s). No, because the run is part of the larger run. Wait, the entire array:\n\nAfter index 6: 8,3, then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Wait, no, original array is [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nWait, at index 6: after 8,3 comes 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (from index 6 to 15). So ten 8s. Then after that, there are three 8s at index 17-19. So those are separate. The first run is ten 8s (replaced by 4s), the next three 8s are a separate run of three, so no replacement. So only the ten 8s are replaced.\n\nTenth test array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nLooking for runs. The run of eight 8s from index 6 to 15: positions 6-15 (eight elements?), wait let's see:\n\nThe array is:\n\n[8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nFrom index 6: eight 8s (positions 6-13, 8 elements?), no. Wait, let's count:\n\nIndex 6:8\n\n7:8\n\n8:8\n\n9:8\n\n10:8\n\n11:8\n\n12:8\n\n13:8\n\n14:8\n\n15:8 \u2192 that's ten 8s (indices 6-15 inclusive, 10 elements). So replace with ten 4s.\n\nEleventh test array:\n\n[3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nRun of eight 8s from index 5 to 14: ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Then later, three 1s, not enough.\n\nTwelfth test array:\n\n[6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nLooking for runs. The array has 2,2,2 at the end. Not enough. So no changes.\n\nThirteenth test array:\n\n[1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The elements at index 10-13: 2,2,2,2 (four). Then 3,3,3 (three). Then later 3,3. No runs of six. So no changes.\n\nFourteenth test array:\n\n[8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]\n\nCheck for runs. No sequences of six or more. All are short.\n\nFifteenth test array:\n\n[8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]\n\nPossible runs: 8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3, etc. No runs of six.\n\nSixteenth test array:\n\n[6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The 3,3,3 at index 16-18. Then 3,3,3 again at 20-22. Not enough. So no changes.\n\nSeventeenth test array:\n\n[3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]\n\nPossible run at index 21-23: 8,8,8. Three. Not enough.\n\nEighteenth test array:\n\n[8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nNineteenth test array:\n\n[3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nTwentieth test array:\n\n[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The elements starting at index 10: 3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3. Wait, let's see:\n\nIndex 10:3,3,3,3 (four 3s), then a 6, then 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). So the six 3s starting at index 15. Replace those six with 4s.\n\nSo from index 15-20: 3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 six 3s \u2192 six 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test array:\n\n[6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\n\nLooking for runs. The elements at index 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3. Six 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second test array:\n\n[8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\n\nRun at index 16-22: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test array:\n\n[2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The elements at index 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). Replace with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-fourth test array:\n\n[1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nRun at index 16-22: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3s). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test array:\n\n[1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n\nRun at index 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth test array:\n\n[8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n\nRun at index 6-9: four 2s. Then at index 14-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (eight 3s). Replace with eight 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test array:\n\n[3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The elements at index 7-9: 3,3,3. Then at 13-17: 3,3,3,3,3 (five). Not enough.\n\nTwenty-eighth test array:\n\n[6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\n\nRun of four 8s (index 8-11). Not enough.\n\nTwenty-ninth test array:\n\n[1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\n\nLooking for runs. The 3,3,3,3 at index 6-9 (four). Not enough.\n\nThirtieth test array:\n\n[8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nSo, applying this pattern to each array in the test input. Each consecutive run of six or more same numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. All others remain the same."
