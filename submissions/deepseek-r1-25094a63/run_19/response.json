        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and 1, I notice that in some of the input arrays, there are sequences of numbers that get replaced with 4s in the output. Let me check the first example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, take the third array: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The output for this array has a sequence of 4s starting at index 4: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, ...]. The original input had six 8s in a row, which became six 4s. Then, later in the same array, there's a sequence of seven 2s starting at index 20, which becomes seven 4s. So it seems like consecutive repeated numbers (like a run of the same number) are being replaced with 4s. But how many consecutive numbers are needed? Let's check other examples.\n\nLooking at the same example, another input array is [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]. The output replaces the six 8s with 4s and the seven 2s with 4s. So maybe when there are 6 or more consecutive same numbers, they get replaced by 4s. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the third array is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. The output replaces the nine 6s starting at index 5 with 4s. So again, a long sequence of same numbers (more than 5?) becomes 4s. But wait, in the first example, the first replaced sequence is six 8s, which are replaced by six 4s. So the threshold seems to be sequences of 6 or more. Let's confirm.\n\nLooking at Example 0's first input array: the input starts with [3,3,2,...]. The output is the same as the input. So there's no replacement here. So maybe only sequences of 6 or more same numbers are replaced. Let's check another example in Example 0. The third array's output had a run of seven 2s turned into 4s. So it's 6 or more consecutive same digits replaced with 4s. That seems consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's take the fifth array in the test input: [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]. Here, the sequence from index 6 to 15 (inclusive) is eight 8s. So according to the pattern, these should be replaced with 4s. Also, in the same array, there's a run of six 1s starting at index 21 (positions 21-26), which would become 4s. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nAnother test input array is the fourth one: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]. The part from index 6 to 15 (positions 6-15) is ten 8s. So those should become 4s. Then, the next run of seven 1s from index 20-26 would become 4s as well.\n\nWait, but the problem's output examples show that consecutive runs of 6 or more are replaced by 4s, but only the part that's 6 or more. So if there's a run of 8, all of them are replaced. So the entire run is turned into 4s, regardless of how long it is beyond 6. For example, in Example 0, the first replaced sequence is six 8s, replaced by six 4s. Another example in Example 1, the third array's 9 6s are replaced by 9 4s.\n\nSo the rule is: in each array, any consecutive sequence of the same number that's 6 or longer is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's apply this to each array in the test input. For each array, scan through and find all consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers, replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nLet's take the third test input array: [8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]. Looking at positions 21-26: six 1s. That would become six 4s. Also, in the input, the first two elements are 8,8. But that's only two, so no replacement. So in the output, the six 1s become 4s.\n\nAnother test array is the fifth: [6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]. The sequence starting at index 6 (8) with 8s. From index 6 to 15 (positions 6-15), that's 9 8s. So replace all with 4s. Then, from index 21 to 26 (positions 21-26 in the original array?), wait let me count: The array is 0-based. Let's list the array elements:\n\nIndices 0-29:\n\n0:6, 1:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1,17:1,18:3,19:1,20:6,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:6,27:2,28:8,29:3.\n\nWait, the run at 6-15 is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 6 to 15 inclusive, which is 10 elements). So that's 10 8s, which should be replaced by 10 4s. Then, the next part is at indices 21-25 (elements 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:6). Wait, 21-25 is five 1s, but 26 is 6, which is different. So the 1s run from 21 to 25, which is five elements. That's only 5, so no replacement. Wait, but in the array, after index 20 (6), the next elements are 1 (index21),1,1,1,1,1 (indices21-25: five 1s?), then index26 is 6. Wait, that's five 1s. So that's not long enough. So in this array, only the 8s run (10 elements) is replaced with 4s. The 1s run at 21-25 (five 1s) remains. Wait, but looking at the test input array 5, the part after 16 is [1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,...]. Wait, maybe the indices are:\n\nLet me recheck the array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3].\n\nIndices 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s) \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nThen at index 21: 1, but after that, 21:1, 22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1 (five 1s) followed by 6. So that's five 1s. No replacement. The next run is index 16-17: two 1s. So in this array, only the 8s are replaced.\n\nAnother test array is the fourth one: [8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]. The 8s run from index6 to 15: 10 8s \u2192 10 4s. Then, the 1s from index19 (assuming the array is 0-based):\n\nWait the array is:\n\nIndices 0:8,1:1,2:2,3:3,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1,17:3,18:8,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:8, etc. So from 19 to 25: seven 1s. So that's seven 1s, which would be replaced with 4s. So in the output, the 8s (10) become 4s, and the seven 1s become 4s.\n\nSo applying this pattern to all arrays in the test input: scan each array for consecutive runs of 6 or more of the same number, replace each such run with 4s of the same length.\n\nSo, let's process each test array:\n\nTest Input array 0: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]. Looking for runs of 6 or more. Let's check each number's consecutive counts:\n\n- 6, then 8 (count 1), 3s (count 3), 8, 1, 8, 3, 8,8 (count 2), etc. No runs of 6. So output is same as input.\n\nTest array 1: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]. Check for runs. 6,6 (2), 8,8 (2), 3,3 (2), 8,8 (2), 1,1 (2), 8,8 (2), 8,8,8 (3). No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nTest array 2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. The 1s from index21-26: six 1s. So replace them with 4s. So the output here would have [..., 4,4,4,4,4,4, ...].\n\nTest array 3: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. The 1s from index20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTest array4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The 8s from index6-15: 10 8s \u2192 4s. The 1s from index19-25: seven 1s \u2192 4s.\n\nTest array5: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The 8s from6-15: 10 \u2192 4s. The 1s from21-25: five \u2192 no replacement. The 1,1 at 16-17: two \u2192 no. So only the 8s become 4s.\n\nTest array6: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. The 8s from7-16: 10 8s (indices6 to15?), need to check. Wait:\n\nArray6 is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3].\n\nIndices0-3: 3,3,3,3 (4) \u2192 no. Then index4:8, index5:3. So 8 at index4, then 3 at5. Then from index6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s). So replaced with 4s. Then from index22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (6 8s) \u2192 replaced with 4s. So in this array, two runs are replaced: 10 8s and 6 8s.\n\nTest array7: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8s from6-16: 11 8s (indices6-16, assuming the array is 30 elements). So replaced with 4s. Then the 8,8,8 at indices25-27: 3 8s \u2192 no. So only the first run.\n\nTest array8: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]. The 8s from6-15: 10 8s \u2192 4s. Then 8,8,8 at17-19 (assuming 8 after 16:6? Let me check the array:\n\n[1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1].\n\nAfter index15 (8), index16 is6, then indices17-19:8,8,8 (3 \u2192 no). So only the first run of 10 8s becomes 4s.\n\nTest array9: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]. The 8s from6-15: 10 \u2192 4s.

No runs of 6.\n\nTest array12: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6].

No runs.\n\nTest array15: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]. The 8,8 at14-15:2. The 3,3,3,3,3 at16-20: five \u2192 no. 3,3,3 at21-23:3 \u2192 no. So no replacements.\n\nTest array16: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]. The 8,8,8 at21-23:3 \u2192 no. 6,6 at12-13:2. So no.\n\nTest array17: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]. The 8,8 at0-1:2. 3,3 at6-7:2. 8,8 at10-11:2. 8,8 at23-24:2. So no.\n\nTest array18: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]. No runs of 6.\n\nTest array19: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. The 8,8,8 at0-2:3 \u2192 no. Then 3,3,3,3,3,3 at12-17: six 3s (from index12 to17: but wait the array is [3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3, ...]. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the array:\n\n[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8].\n\nAt index10-15: 3,3,3,3,6,3. So the run of four 3s (indices10-13) is four \u2192 no. Then after 6, there's 3,3,3,3,3,3 (indices16-21? Let's see:\n\nOriginal array after index15:\n\n6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8, etc.\n\nSo indices15:6, 16:3,17:3,18:3,19:3,20:3,21:3. So from16-21: six 3s. So this run of six 3s should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nTest array20: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. At indices16-21: six 3s (if the array is [...,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] \u2192 from index16:3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 six \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest array21: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]. The run of 3s from indices16-22: seven 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest array22: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]. The 3s from indices16-21: six \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest array23: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]. The 3s from indices16-22: seven 3s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nTest array24: [1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]. The 3s from indices16-22: seven \u2192 replaced.\n\nTest array25: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]. The 3s from indices13-20: eight \u2192 replaced.\n\nTest array26: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]. The 3s from indices13-18: six \u2192 replaced.\n\nTest array27: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]. The 8s at indices8-11: four \u2192 no.\n\nTest array28: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]. The 3s at indices6-9: four \u2192 no.\n\nTest array29: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]. The 8s at indices7-8: two \u2192 no.\n\nSo for each test array, we need to scan for consecutive runs of 6 or more and replace with 4s. The output arrays will have those runs replaced.\n\nNow, applying this pattern to each of the test input arrays. Let's take the third test array as an example:\n\nTest array2: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The 1s at indices21-26 (inclusive) are six 1s. So those positions become 4s.\n\nOriginal array:\n\nIndices 21-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1 \u2192 replaced with 4,4,4,4,4,4.\n\nSo the output array would be the same except those six elements are 4s.\n\nAnother example: test array4: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nIndices6-15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Indices19-25: seven 1s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the output array would have 4s in those positions.\n\nNow, the final answer is to generate the test output arrays with these replacements."
