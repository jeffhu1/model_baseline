        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, especially Example 0 and Example 1, the input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to have some of those numbers replaced with 4s. Let me compare the input and output of the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input has several sequences of the same number. For instance, in the third list of the input, the part [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4]. Similarly, other lists have sequences like [2,2,2,2,2,2,2] turning into [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. Wait, but the output for that third list in Example 0 is [4,4,4,4,4,4], replacing six 8s with six 4s. But in the same example's second input list, there's a longer run of 8s. Let me check:\n\nOriginal third input list in Example 0:\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput third list:\n[1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\nSo the six 8s became six 4s, and the seven 2s became seven 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of the same number longer than 5 is replaced with 4s. Because 6 and 7 are both over 5. Let's check other parts.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input lists. Take the third input list:\n[2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nOutput becomes:\n[2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nSo here, nine 6s are replaced with nine 4s. Similarly, in other lists, sequences of 8s or other numbers longer than 5 are replaced by 4s. So the pattern seems to be: in each list, whenever there's a consecutive sequence of the same number with length 6 or more, replace all elements in that sequence with 4. Let me confirm with more examples.\n\nIn Example 0's fourth input list:\n[1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nThe output has the six 8s turned into 4s and the seven 2s into 4s. So yes, consecutive runs of 6 or more same numbers become 4s.\n\nNow, check if there are any exceptions. For example, in Example 0's first two input lists, there are no such long runs. The first input list has three 8s, which is less than 6, so they stay as 8s. Similarly, in the second input list, maybe there are no runs of 6. So the output for those lists remains the same.\n\nSo the rule is: For each list in the input, replace every consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s. The rest of the numbers stay the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's look at each list in the test input and find sequences of 6 or more same numbers.\n\nLet's take the test input lists one by one.\n\nFirst test input list:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nLooking for consecutive repeats. The first elements are 6,8,3,3,3 (only 3 in a row), then 8, etc. No runs of 6, so this list remains unchanged.\n\nSecond test input list:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nNo runs of 6. The 8,8,8 at the end is three. So unchanged.\n\nThird test input list:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking here: after the 2,1, there's 1,1,1,1,1,1. That's six 1s. So these six 1s should become 4s. So the output for this list would have [2,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]. Let me check the positions: positions 21-26 (0-based) are six 1s. So replace those with 4s.\n\nFourth test input list:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nHere, the sequence from position 20 to 26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). That's more than 6. So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input list:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nLooking at the 8s starting at position 6: positions 6-15 are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 8s. Replace all with 4s. Then, after that, positions 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s) which also get replaced. So in this list, two sequences: the 10 8s become 4s, and the seven 1s become 4s. The rest remains.\n\nSixth test input list:\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\nHere, positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s) become 4s. Also, positions 21-25: five 1s (so no, only 5, not replaced). The 1,1 at position 16-17 is two, so no. Then positions 22-26: five 1s (positions 22-26 are 1,1,1,1,1). Wait, let me recount. The list's 6th element is index 5 (assuming 0-based). Let me list the elements:\n\nIndices 0:6, 1:1, 2:3, 3:1,4:8,5:6,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8,16:1,17:1,18:3,19:1,20:6,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:6, etc. So from index 6 to 15: 8s. That's 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, indices 21-25: five 1s. So no replacement there. The 1s at 16-17: two, no. So the output would have 4s from index6-15.\n\nSeventh test input list:\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\nLooking here: the first four 3s (indices0-3) are four, so no. Then at index4:8. Then from index5:3, then 8. Then from index6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s). Replace those with 4s. Then from index22-27: eight 8s? Wait, the list is:\n\nindexes after 16:1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3. So starting at index22 (if the list is 30 elements), but let me count. The list is 30 elements. The indexes for the 8s after 1,3,1,1,6,2 are positions 22-27 (since 16+6=22?), but perhaps better to list the entire array:\n\nOriginal seventh list:\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nSo from index6 (value 8) to index15: 8s. That's 10 8s. So replace with 4s. Then, after index22 (value8) to index27: six 8s (positions 22-27). So those six 8s become 4s. So in the output, from 6-15: 4s, and 22-27:4s. The rest remains.\n\nEighth test input list:\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\nHere, from index6 to index16: 8,8,... eight 8s, but wait:\n\nOriginal list: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nFrom index6 to index16: 8s (11 elements: indices6-16). That's 11 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, the 8,8,8 at indices26-28: three, so no. So output for this list would replace indices6-16 with 4s.\n\nNinth test input list:\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\nLooking at indices6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s). Replace with 4s. Then, indices17-19: three 8s, so no. Also, indices21-23: 8,8,8? No, after index15 is 6, then 8,8,8 at 17-19. So that's three, no replacement. So in this list, the 10 8s become 4s.\n\nTenth test input list:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\nIndices6-15: 8s. Ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then the 8,8,8 at the end (indices26-28) three, so no. So output here has 4s from 6-15.\n\nEleventh test input list:\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\nIndices5-14: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then the 1,1,1 at indices26-28: three, no.\n\nTwelfth test input list:\n[6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\nLooking for runs. The 2,2,2 at the end: three. No. No long runs here. So unchanged.\n\nThirteenth test input list:\n[1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 6]\nCheck for consecutive runs. 8,8 (two), 2,2,2,2 (four), 3,3,3 (three), etc. No runs of six. So no change.\n\nFourteenth test input list:\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\nNo runs of six. All sequences are shorter. So no change.\n\nFifteenth test input list:\n[8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 6, 1, 1, 3]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3 at indices 16-18: three. 8,8,8 at indices 18-20 (if length is correct). Let me see:\n\nThe list is [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]. The 8,8,1,... the 3,3,3 is three, 8,8,8 is three, 3,3,3 again. All less than six. So no replacements.\n\nSixteenth test input list:\n[6, 8, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6]\nCheck for runs. 3,3,3 at 16-18: three. 3,3,3 at 19-21 (if any). Let me check:\n\nThe list is [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]. The 3,3,3 at positions 16-18. Then 3,3,3 at 20-22 (if the indices are correct). Wait, 3,3,3,6,3,3,3. So the three 3s followed by 6, then three 3s. Each is three in a row. No six. So no replacements.\n\nSeventeenth test input list:\n[3, 8, 1, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 1]\nLooking for runs. 8,8,8 at positions 21-23. Three. 6,6,8: two 6s. No. So no.\n\nEighteenth test input list:\n[8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 6, 1]\nCheck for runs. 8,8 at the start (two). 3,3,1: two 3s. 8,8 at positions 9-10. 3,3 at 11-12. 8,8 at 23-24. All less than six. So no.\n\nNineteenth test input list:\n[3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 8]\nLooking for runs. 3,3 at positions4-5. 3,3 at7-8. 1,1 at12-13. 1,1 at14-15. No six in a row.\n\nTwentieth test input list:\n[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\nCheck for runs. 8,8,8 at start (three). Then 3,3,3,3,3,3 (positions 10-15: six 3s). Replace with 4s. Then positions16-20: three 3s. So in this list, the six 3s become 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test input list:\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\nLooking for runs. The 3,3,3,3,3,3 at positions16-21: six 3s. Replace with 4s. Also, 8,8,8 at positions24-26: three, so no.\n\nTwenty-second test input list:\n[8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\nHere, the 3s from positions16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s. So indices16-22 (seven elements) become 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test input list:\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\nLooking for runs. 3,3,3,3,3,3 at positions16-21: six 3s. Replace with 4s. Also, 8,8,8 at positions10-12: three, no.\n\nTwenty-fourth test input list:\n[1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\nHere, the 3s from positions16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test input list:\n[1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\nThe 3s from positions16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth test input list:\n[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\nThe 3s from positions14-21: eight 3s. Replace with 4s. Also, the 2,2,2,2 at positions5-8: four, no. So the output for this list has 4s from 14-21.\n\nTwenty-seventh test input list:\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\nCheck for runs. 3,3,3,3,3 at positions14-18: five 3s. Not enough. So no.\n\nTwenty-eighth test input list:\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\nLooking for runs. 8,8,8,8 at positions8-11: four. So no.\n\nTwenty-ninth test input list:\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\nCheck for runs. 3,3,3,3 at positions7-10: four. No.\n\nThirtieth test input list:\n[8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\nNo runs of six.\n\nSo applying the pattern to each test input list, replacing consecutive runs of six or more same numbers with 4s. Now, I need to write the output lists with these replacements. Let's format this as per the examples, each list in the output is the same as the input except for the sequences replaced with 4s."
