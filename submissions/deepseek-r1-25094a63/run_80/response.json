        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this puzzle. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. The input and output are lists of numbers. Looking at the examples, I need to see what changes between the input and output.\n\nStarting with Example 0. Let's compare the input and output rows. Let's pick one of the input rows and see where the numbers change. For instance, the third input row in Example 0 is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. The corresponding output is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]. \n\nNoticing that in the input, there's a sequence of six 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9), and in the output, those are replaced with six 4s. Similarly, later in the input, there are seven 2s starting at position 20 (indices 20-26), which in the output become seven 4s. So it looks like consecutive repeated numbers are being replaced with 4s, but only certain lengths. Wait, the first replacement is six 8s turned into six 4s. The second part is seven 2s turned into seven 4s. Hmm. So maybe sequences of 6 or more of the same number are replaced with 4s?\n\nLooking at another example. Let's check the next input row in Example 0. The fourth input is [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]. The output is [1, 2, 8, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2, 1, 3]. Again, the six 8s are replaced with 4s, and seven 2s become seven 4s. So the pattern here is that whenever there's a run of six or more identical numbers, they get replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but in some cases, the runs are exactly 6, others are longer. Let me check another example. In Example 1, the third input row is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]. The output for this row is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. Here, there's a run of nine 6s starting at position 5, which are replaced with nine 4s. So the rule seems to be: any consecutive sequence of the same number with length 6 or more is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, some rows don't have any such sequences. For instance, the first two rows in Example 0's input and output are the same. So maybe only when there are runs of 6 or more, they are replaced. If there are no such runs, the row remains unchanged.\n\nLet me confirm this with another example. Take the fifth input row in Example 0: [3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6, 2]. The output is [3,3,8,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,6,1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,2]. The 6 8s become 4s, and the 8 2s become 4s. So again, runs of 6 or more are replaced.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third row in input is [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. Output replaces the nine 6s with 4s. Similarly, other rows in the output of Example 1 have sequences of 4s where there were runs of 6 or more same numbers.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the input list, if the length of the sequence is 6 or more, replace each element in that sequence with 4. Other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, the test input is a list of 30 rows. For each row, I need to check if there are consecutive sequences of 6 or more same numbers and replace those with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input row:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. Let's go through each element:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three 3s \u2192 not enough\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two 8s \u2192 no\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three 1s\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two 2s\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo sequences of 6 or more. So this row remains the same.\n\nNext test input row: \n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three \u2192 no\n- 2: single\n\nNo runs of 6. So this row remains the same.\n\nThird test input row:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check:\n\nAt position 20: 2,1, then starting at index 21 (0-based), there are 6 consecutive 1s: [1,1,1,1,1,1]. That's six 1s. So replace them with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this row would be:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nFourth test input row:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. At index 20: seven 1s (positions 20-26). So replace with seven 4s.\n\nOutput row becomes: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3]\n\nFifth test input row:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nCheck runs. Starting at index 6 (value 8), there are 10 consecutive 8s (positions 6-15). Replace with 10 4s. Then at index 20, there are seven 1s (positions 20-26). Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo output row becomes: [8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,8]\n\nWait, let's count the positions. The input is 30 elements. Let's index from 0:\n\nOriginal row: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nThe 8s start at index 6 (value 8) and continue through index 15. That's 10 elements (indices 6-15 inclusive). So all those 8s become 4s. Then the 1s from index 20 to 26 (seven elements) become 4s. So the output row would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]? Wait, no, the original at index 27 is 8, so after replacement, the row would have:\n\nPositions 0-5: unchanged (8,1,2,3,8,6).\n\nPositions 6-15: ten 4s.\n\nPositions 16-19: 1,3,8,1.\n\nPositions 20-26: seven 4s.\n\nThen position 27 is 8, 28:3, 29:6, 30:8? Wait, the original has 30 elements. Wait, indexes 0-29.\n\nOriginal positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements). Then positions 20-26: seven 1s. So the output would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8] \u2192 Wait, but the original ends at index 29. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal row: indexes 0-29.\n\nAfter replacements:\n\n0:8\n\n1:1\n\n2:2\n\n3:3\n\n4:8\n\n5:6\n\n6-15: 10 4s (indices 6-15)\n\n16:1\n\n17:3\n\n18:8\n\n19:1\n\n20-26: seven 4s (indices 20-26)\n\n27:8\n\n28:3\n\n29:6\n\nWait, but the original element at index 27 is 8, and in the test input, it's part of the eighth element in the list. Wait, the test input fifth row is:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nSo indexes 6-15 are the 8s. Then index 16 is 1, and so on. The element at index 27 is 8 (original), which is after the seven 1s (indices 20-26). So the output for the fifth test row would be:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]. Wait, but the original row ends at index 29. Let me count again:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nIndices 0:8\n\n1:1\n\n2:2\n\n3:3\n\n4:8\n\n5:6\n\n6:8\n\n7:8\n\n8:8\n\n9:8\n\n10:8\n\n11:8\n\n12:8\n\n13:8\n\n14:8\n\n15:8\n\n16:1\n\n17:3\n\n18:8\n\n19:1\n\n20:1\n\n21:1\n\n22:1\n\n23:1\n\n24:1\n\n25:1\n\n26:1\n\n27:8\n\n28:3\n\n29:6\n\nWait, no. The test input fifth row is:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nSo index 27 is 8, 28:3, 29:6, and the last element is 8? Wait, the length is 30 elements. Let's count:\n\nElements from index 0 to 29:\n\n0:8\n\n1:1\n\n2:2\n\n3:3\n\n4:8\n\n5:6\n\n6:8\n\n7:8\n\n8:8\n\n9:8\n\n10:8\n\n11:8\n\n12:8\n\n13:8\n\n14:8\n\n15:8 \u2192 that's 10 elements (6-15 inclusive)\n\n16:1\n\n17:3\n\n18:8\n\n19:1\n\n20:1\n\n21:1\n\n22:1\n\n23:1\n\n24:1\n\n25:1\n\n26:1 \u2192 seven 1s (20-26)\n\n27:8\n\n28:3\n\n29:6\n\nSo the output should replace indices 6-15 (10 8s) with 10 4s and indices 20-26 (seven 1s) with seven 4s. So the output row becomes:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]. Wait, but the original ends at index 29 with 8. So the correct output row should be:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 1, 3, 8, 1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]. But wait, that's 30 elements. Yes, 0-29. So indices 6-15 (inclusive) is 10 elements (6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) replaced. Then 20-26 (7 elements) replaced. The rest are same.\n\nYes.\n\nContinuing this way for all test input rows. Each time a run of 6 or more same numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's process all test input rows similarly.\n\nThe test input has 30 rows, but I'll need to process each one. But for brevity, the answer should follow the same pattern as the training examples, replacing runs of 6+ same numbers with 4s."
