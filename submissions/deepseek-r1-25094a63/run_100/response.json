        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and determine how the input arrays are transformed into the output arrays. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example 0. The input and output arrays are given. Let's compare them to see what changed.\n\nLooking at the third input array in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\nHmm, I notice that sequences of the same number (like 8s and 2s) are being replaced with 4s. Specifically, in the input, there's a run of six 8s starting at index 4, and in the output, those become six 4s. Then later, seven 2s become seven 4s. So maybe the rule is that when there's a consecutive run of a certain number (maybe of length 6 or more?), replace each element in that run with 4.\n\nWait, let's check another example. Take the fourth input in Example 0:\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\nAgain, the six 8s are replaced with 4s, and the seven 2s become 4s. So the pattern seems to be replacing consecutive runs of the same number with 4s, but only if the run length is at least 6. Let's confirm this.\n\nLooking at the first input array in Example 0, the input and output are the same. So in that case, maybe there were no runs of 6 or more. Let's check:\nInput: [3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\nThe longest run here is five 3s (indices 10-14: 3,3,3,3,3) but that's 5 elements. The output is the same as input, so the rule applies only to runs of 6 or more.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each array, any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 6 or longer is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nLet's check another example. In Example 1, the third input array:\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nHere, the sequence of nine 6s is replaced with nine 4s. That fits the rule.\n\nSo the transformation is: replace every consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each array in the test input and check for runs of 6 or more, replacing them with 4s.\n\nLooking at the Test Input:\n\nFirst array:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nLooking for runs of 6+ same numbers. The longest run here is maybe three 3s (indices 2-4: 3,3,3) which is 3, so no replacement. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nSecond array:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nCheck for runs of 6. The longest runs are two 8s (indices 3-4, then 8,8 at 10-11, 8,8,8 at 26-28). None are 6+, so this array remains the same.\n\nThird array:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking for runs. At indices 21-26 (assuming 0-based), there's a sequence of six 1s (1,1,1,1,1,1). So replace those six 1s with six 4s. The rest stays the same.\n\nFourth array:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nCheck runs. From index 20 to 26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth array:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nCheck runs. From index 6 to 15: ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Also, from index 19 to 25: seven 1s. Replace those with seven 4s.\n\nWait, wait. Let's count:\n\nStarting at index 6 (0-based) the elements are 8, then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (that's 10 elements). So positions 6-15 inclusive. Replace with 4s.\n\nThen from index 19 (which is after the 1,3,8,1 part), starting at index 19: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So replace those seven 1s with 4s.\n\nSo fifth array's output would have 10 4s and 7 4s in those positions.\n\nSimilarly, proceeding through each array in the test input, looking for runs of 6 or more same numbers, replacing each with 4s of same length.\n\nSo applying this to all test input arrays. Now, let's process each test input array step by step.\n\nBut to save time, since the user wants the output in the same format as the training examples, which is the same as the input but with 4s replacing runs of 6 or more.\n\nSo the final answer would be each array in the test input, with all consecutive sequences of 6 or more identical numbers replaced by 4s of the same length."
