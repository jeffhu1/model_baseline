        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let's look at the examples given.\n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input is a list of numbers, and the output seems to replace certain sequences with 4s. For instance, in the third input array of Example 0, the input is:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nThe output for this is:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nI notice that the sequence of six 8s starting at position 4 (indices 4-9) in the input is replaced by six 4s. Similarly, the seven 2s starting at position 20 (indices 20-26) are replaced by seven 4s. So it looks like consecutive repeated numbers are being replaced by 4s if their count is 6 or more. Wait, but in this case, the first sequence is six 8s, and the second is seven 2s. Both are replaced by 4s. So maybe the rule is that consecutive runs of a number that are 6 or longer are replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nBut let's check another example. Take the first input array in Example 0:\n\n[3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\n\nIn the output, the three 8s (indices 6-8) remain 8s. Then there's a sequence of five 3s (indices 10-14) in the input. But in the output, they're still 3s. So that's not replaced. So the replacement only happens when the consecutive numbers are 6 or more in a row. Because in the third input array, the 8s were six in a row, so replaced by 4s. Similarly, the 2s were seven in a row, replaced by 4s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. For instance, the third input array is:\n\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the sequence of nine 6s (indices 5-13) are replaced by nine 4s. So again, consecutive runs of 6 or more get replaced by 4s of the same length. \n\nBut wait, what about in the output where there's a run of 4s but the original numbers vary. For example, in some arrays, after the replacement, there are 4s in the output where the input had a long run of the same number. So the pattern seems to be: for any consecutive run of the same number that is 6 or longer, replace all elements in that run with 4, keeping the same length of the run.\n\nNow, let's check another example in Example 0. The fourth input array:\n\n[1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\n\nOutput:\n\n[1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\n\nHere, the input has six 8s (indices 4-9) and seven 2s (indices 20-26), both replaced by 4s. So the rule holds.\n\nLooking at the test input. Let's take the fifth array in the test input:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nHere, there's a run of 10 8s (indices 6-15). According to the pattern, this should be replaced by 10 4s. Then, after that, there's a run of five 1s (indices 20-24), which is less than six, so they remain 1s. The 1s at indices 16-17 are two in a row, so they stay. The 1 at 21 is followed by a 6, so the run of 1s is 1. Wait, wait, the array is:\n\nLooking at indices 20-24: the array has [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, ...]. So indices 20 (assuming 0-based) would be the 21st element. Wait, maybe I need to count correctly. Let's parse the test input fifth array:\n\nTest input fifth array:\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nIndices 0-29:\n\n0:6, 1:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:8, 5:6, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:8, 16:1, 17:1, 18:3, 19:1, 20:6, 21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1, 26:6, 27:2, 28:8, 29:3.\n\nSo from index 6 to 15 (8 to 8, 10 elements) is a run of 10 8s. So that should be replaced by 10 4s. Then, the next runs: indices 16-17 are two 1s, so no replacement. Then at indices 21-25 (21:1, 22:1, 23:1, 24:1, 25:1) is a run of five 1s, which is less than six, so they remain. The sixth element (index 5) is 6, which is single. So in the output, the 8s from 6-15 become 4s. The rest stay as is.\n\nSo applying this to each array in the test input, we need to look for consecutive runs of the same number with length >=6 and replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's check all the test input arrays.\n\nTake the fourth test input array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking at the elements starting at index 6 (assuming 0-based). The elements from index 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 8s. So replace with 4s. Also, the elements from index 19 to 25: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1. That's seven 1s, which should be replaced with 4s. Then, the last element is 8, but no run. So the output array would have 4s in those positions.\n\nSo the transformed array would be:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 1, 3, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nSimilarly, the fifth test input array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nThe run from index 6-15 (8s) becomes 4s. The 1s from 21-25 (five 1s) stay. The 1s at 16-17 (two) stay. So output becomes:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nAnother test input array: the sixth one:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The first four elements are 3,3,3,3 (four 3s) \u2013 no replacement. Then 8 at index 4 (single). Then 3 at index 5 (single). Then 8s from index 6 to 15 (10 8s) \u2013 replace with 4s. Then there's a run of eight 8s from index 22-29? Wait, let's check the array:\n\nWait the sixth array in test input is:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nIndices 0-3: 3s (four) \u2013 no. Index 4: 8. Index 5:3. Then indices 6-15: eight 8s (from index 6 to 15 is 10 elements? Wait, indices 6 to 15 would be 10 elements (6-15 inclusive). Let me count: 6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8,13:8,14:8,15:8. So that's 10 8s. So replace those with 4s. Then, after that, elements 16:1,17:3, etc. Then, towards the end, indices 22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). So those should also be replaced with 4s. So the output would have 4s from 6-15 and 22-27. Let me check:\n\nOriginal array elements from 22-27 (indices 22 to 27) are 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six in a row). So replace with 4s. So the output array would be:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,1,1,6,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3]\n\nYes. So that's the pattern.\n\nSo applying this to all arrays in the test input: scan each array, find all consecutive runs of the same number with length >=6, and replace each element in those runs with 4.\n\nNow, let's process each test input array one by one.\n\nTest Input Array 0:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nCheck for runs of 6 or more. Let's go step by step:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: three in a row\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: three\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: two\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single\n\nNo runs of 6 or more. So output is same as input.\n\nTest Input Array 1:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: two\n- 8,8: two\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: two\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: two\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: two\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: three\n- 2: single\n\nNo runs of 6 or more. Output same as input.\n\nTest Input Array 2:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nCheck the sequence starting at index 21: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (indices 21-26). That's six 1s. So replace with 4s.\n\nThe array becomes:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nTest Input Array 3:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nAt indices 20-26: seven 1s (positions 20-26) \u2192 replace with 4s. So from index 20 to 26 (inclusive), which is seven elements, replace with 4s.
