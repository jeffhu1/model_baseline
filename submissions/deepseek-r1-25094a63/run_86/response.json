        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Let me start by looking at the first example. \n\nLooking at Example 0's input and output. The input is a bunch of lists, and the output seems to have some numbers replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, so the consecutive 8s starting at position 4 (0-based index 4) are replaced with 4s. Then later, the consecutive 2s starting at position 20 (index 20) are replaced with 4s. Wait, but the count here\u2014how long are those sequences? The first part: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (6 elements) become 4s. Then the 2s are seven in a row, also turned into 4s. But in the output, those sequences are replaced by the same number of 4s. \n\nLooking at another input-output pair in Example 0, like the fourth input:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the 8s from index 4 to 9 (6 elements) become 4s, and then the 2s from index 20 to 26 (7 elements) become 4s. Wait, but the output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 (seven 4s). So it seems like whenever there's a run of 6 or more identical numbers, those are replaced by 4s of the same length. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Take the third input list:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the 6s starting at index 5 are 9 elements long (from 5 to 13), which are replaced by 9 4s. So the pattern is: any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. Wait, but in Example 0's first output, the first list doesn't have any 4s. Let's check the first input list of Example 0:\n\nInput: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]\nOutput is the same as input. So why? Because maybe the consecutive numbers in the input here are all less than 6 in length. Let's check:\n\n- 8,8,8: length 3 \u2192 no replacement.\n- 3,3,3,3,3: length 5 \u2192 no replacement.\nSo yes, so the rule is that any run of exactly 6 or more consecutive same numbers is replaced with 4s of the same length.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the third input list's 8s are 6 in a row, which become 4s. Then the 2s are seven in a row, which become 4s. So the rule is that runs of 6 or more same numbers are replaced by 4s. So the pattern is: wherever there's a consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical elements, replace each element in that sequence with 4. The length of the sequence remains the same, but the numbers are all 4.\n\nLooking at another example in Example 1's input:\n\nInput list 17: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\nOutput: [8,1,3,6,4,4,6,6,3,3,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,3,8,2,3,6,2,8,2]\n\nWait, the input here has a run of 7 8s starting at index 13 (positions 13-19: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8 \u2192 7 elements). So in the output, these become 7 4s. Similarly, the runs of 6 or more are replaced by 4s. \n\nSo the transformation is: for any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each element in that run with 4, keeping the same length. \n\nNow, let's check the test input. The test input has multiple lists. For each list, we need to find runs of 6 or more same numbers and replace them with 4s. Let's look at one of the test input lists to see.\n\nTake the fifth test input list:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The part starting at 8,6,8,8,... Let's see:\n\nPositions 5: 8,6. Then positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 10 consecutive 8s. So this run would be replaced by 10 4s. Then after that, in the same list, positions 20-24: 1,1,1,1,1 (5 elements \u2192 no replacement). Then positions 25-29: 6,2,8,3. So the only run here is the 10 8s, which becomes 4s. So the output for this list would have 10 4s in positions 6-15. \n\nAnother test list, say the fourth input:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. From position 6 (assuming 0-based index), after the 8,6 comes a run of 8s: positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements). So replace those with 4s. Then later, positions 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (7 elements), which is 7 1s. So those would become 4s. So in the output list, those two runs would be 10 4s and 7 4s.\n\nSo applying this rule to all the test input lists: for each list, check each consecutive run. If the run is 6 or longer, replace all elements in the run with 4s. Keep other elements as they are.\n\nNow, let's verify this pattern against the training examples to make sure. For example, in Example 0's input list 2:\n\nOriginal input has a run of 6 8s (positions 4-9) and a run of 7 2s (positions 20-26). Both are replaced by 4s. The output matches this. Similarly, in Example 1's input list 2, a run of 9 6s becomes 9 4s. \n\nYes, this seems consistent. Therefore, the transformation is: replace all consecutive sequences of 6 or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Each list in the test input needs to be processed by replacing any runs of 6+ same numbers with 4s. Let's process each test input list one by one.\n\nBut since there are multiple lists in the test input, I need to process each list accordingly. Let's take the first test input list:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nCheck for runs of 6 or more. Let's look for consecutive duplicates:\n\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3,3,3 (3)\n- 8 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 1 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1,1,1 (3)\n- 3 (single)\n- 1 (single)\n- 2,2 (2)\n- 6 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 2 (single)\n- 3 (single)\n- 8 (single)\n- 6 (single)\n\nNo runs of 6 or more here. So the output is the same as input.\n\nNext list in test input:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 6,6 (2)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 3,3 (2)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 1,1 (2)\n- 8,8 (2)\n- 8,8,8 (3)\n- 2 (single)\n\nNo runs of 6 or more. So output same.\n\nThird list:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's check the sequence:\n\nPositions 0-1: 8,8 (2)\nThen at positions 20-25: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (6 elements). This is a run of six 1s. So this should be replaced with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this list would be:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6]\n\nFourth test input list:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck for runs. Looking at the end of the list: positions 20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 \u2192 seven 1s. So this run should become seven 4s.\n\nSo the output for this list would be:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,3]\n\nFifth test input list:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nHere, positions 6-15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced by 10 4s. Then positions 19-25: seven 1s \u2192 replaced by seven 4s.\n\nSo the output for this list becomes:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,3,6,8]\n\nContinuing this way for all test input lists. Each run of six or more same numbers becomes 4s. The rest stay the same.\n\nSo applying this pattern to each list in the test input will generate the correct output."
