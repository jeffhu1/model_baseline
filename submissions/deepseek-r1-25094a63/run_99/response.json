        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. The user provided a bunch of input and output examples, and I need to find the transformation rule to apply to the test input. \n\nLooking at the first example, the input and output arrays are mostly the same except for some sequences replaced with 4s. For instance, in the third line of Example 0's input, there's a sequence of eight 8s in the input: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, ...]. The output replaces those six 8s (positions 4-9) with 4s. Wait, let me count: positions 4 to 9 are six elements (8,8,8,8,8,8), which in the output become six 4s. Similarly, in the next line of input, there's another sequence of six 8s starting at position 4, which becomes six 4s.\n\nBut wait, looking at other parts. For example, in the third array of Example 0's input, after replacing the six 8s with 4s, there's another part later where seven 2s are replaced with 4s. Wait, the input part is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], which becomes [4,4,4,4,4,4,4]. So that's seven elements. Hmm, maybe the rule is to replace sequences of six or more identical numbers with 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input array starts with [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8...]. The output replaces positions 5-13 (nine 6s) with 4s. Wait, no: the input starts as 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6 (nine 6s), and in the output, they are replaced by nine 4s. So maybe the rule is that any run of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s. The count has to be exactly six or more.\n\nWait, in Example 0's third input array, the run of six 8s is replaced by 4s. Then, later in the same array, there's a run of seven 2s, which becomes seven 4s. So the rule seems to be: wherever there is a consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number, replace all elements in that sequence with 4s. The length of the run needs to be at least six.\n\nLet me check other examples. In Example 0, the first input array has a run of three 8s (positions 6-8), which remains the same in the output. So runs shorter than six are left untouched. That supports the idea that the transformation is to replace runs of six or more with 4s.\n\nLooking at another part in Example 0: the 13th input array (index 12) is [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]. The output for this array is [8,6,2,8,2,2,2,3,3,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,3,2,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. Here, the original input has a run of six 3s (positions 22-27), which are replaced by six 4s. So yes, exactly six elements.\n\nAnother example in the same input array: the 18th array in Example 0's input is [2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]. The output shows that the ten 1s (positions 10-19) are replaced by seven 4s (since the output is [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the input array's elements from position 10: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is ten 1s. The output array has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4, ...]. Wait, in the output for this array, positions 10-19: in the input, those are ten 1s. The output replaces the first seven with 4s? Wait, looking at the output for this array:\n\nThe input is [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]. The output is [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]. So the first seven 1s (positions 10-16) are replaced by 4s, but the next three remain 1s. That's confusing. Wait, but the input has ten consecutive 1s. Why only seven replaced? Maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the indices. The array is zero-based. So the first element is index 0. So the 10th element is index 9? Wait, no. Wait, the initial elements are:\n\nIndices 0-9: [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8]\n\nThen indices 10-19: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo that's ten 1s. The output for this array is:\n\n[2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nSo from index 10 to 16 (7 elements), they become 4s. Then indices 17-19 are 1s again. But the input had 10 consecutive 1s. So why not replace all ten? That contradicts the previous pattern. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule here.\n\nWait, maybe the rule isn't to replace all consecutive runs of 6 or more, but to replace the first occurrence of a run of exactly six or more. Or perhaps the replacement is applied to the first such run in the array. But in Example 0's 18th array, there's a run of 10 1s. The output replaces the first seven with 4s. Wait, maybe the replacement is to replace the first six elements of a run of six or more with 4s? But in the previous examples, like in the third array of Example 0, a run of six 8s is replaced by six 4s, which matches. Similarly, a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. So why here, a run of ten 1s is replaced by seven 4s?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in my observation. Let me recheck. Oh, wait, maybe the arrays in the examples are different. Let me look again at Example 0's input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 0's 18th input array:\n\nInput: [2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nOutput: [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nAh, the output shows that the first 7 elements (indices 10-16) are 4s, and the next three (indices 17-19) are 1s. But the input had 10 consecutive 1s. So why 7 4s? That's seven elements. That's more than six. Maybe the rule isn't to replace all elements in the run. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace the first six elements of any run of six or more, and leave the rest as is. But that would explain replacing 6 elements. But here seven are replaced. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace the first run of six or more, but only if it's exactly six. Wait, but in Example 0's third array, the run is six 8s, replaced by six 4s. Then in the 18th array, a run of ten 1s is replaced by seven 4s. That doesn't fit. Maybe the rule is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace runs of exactly six elements with 4s, and runs longer than six are left as is. But that contradicts the earlier example where a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s.\n\nHmm. Let me check another example. In Example 1's third input array:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nThe output is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]. Here, the input has a run of nine 6s (positions 5-13), which are all replaced by 4s. So that's nine 4s. So the replacement is for runs of six or more, regardless of the length. So why in Example 0's 18th array, the ten 1s were replaced by seven 4s? There's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recheck the 18th array's output. Wait, in Example 0's 18th array, the input has from position 10: 10 1s. The output shows 4s from positions 10 to 16, which is seven 4s. Then positions 17-19 are 1s. So that's seven 4s followed by three 1s, making 10 elements. So the original run of ten 1s is split into 7 4s and 3 1s. That's strange. Unless there's another rule here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement isn't for consecutive elements, but for elements in certain positions. But that seems less likely. \n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is to replace the first occurrence of a run of exactly six elements. But in the third array of Example 0, there's a run of six 8s, replaced by six 4s. Then, in the same array, a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to any run of six or more elements, regardless of their position in the array. But then why in the 18th array, the ten 1s are only partially replaced. Unless there's a mistake in the example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement applies to runs of six or more, but only the first such run in the array. Let's check. In Example 0's third array, the first run of six 8s is replaced by 4s, and then the later run of seven 2s is also replaced. So that's two runs. So the replacement applies to all runs of six or more. So why in the 18th array, the run of ten 1s is replaced by seven 4s followed by three 1s. That doesn't fit. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the example data. Let me check the example 0's 18th input and output again.\n\nInput array 18 (from Example 0's input):\n\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nOutput array 18:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nLooking at the output, the elements from index 10 to 16 (7 elements) are 4s, then the next three are 1s. The original input here had 10 consecutive 1s. So the replacement seems to have split the run into 7 4s and 3 1s, which doesn't make sense. Unless there's an error in the example. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different rule here. \n\nWait, maybe the rule is to replace runs of six or more elements with 4s, but only if they are part of a larger pattern. For example, maybe the run has to start at a certain position. But looking at the first example, the run starts at position 4 (0-based) in the third input array. The output replaces those six elements with 4s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in each array, the first run of six or more is replaced, and subsequent runs are left as is. But in the third array of Example 0, there are two runs replaced. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that in the entire list of arrays, only certain runs are replaced. But that seems unlikely, as the problem is to find a pattern in each individual array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace the first instance of a run of six or more, and then any subsequent run of six or more in the same array is replaced as well. But in that case, why in the 18th array, the run of ten 1s is only partially replaced.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the example's output. Let me recheck. For example, in the 18th array of Example 0's output, the input is:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nOutput is:\n\n[2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nSo the first seven 1s are replaced by 4s, and the remaining three 1s are left. But the input has ten consecutive 1s. So perhaps there's another condition here. Maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six, but if the run is longer than six, only the first six are replaced. Wait, but in other examples, like the third array, a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s. So that contradicts that idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of six or more, but only the first six elements are replaced with 4s, and the rest remain. So, for example, a run of 10 would become six 4s followed by four original numbers. But in Example 0's third array, a run of seven 2s is replaced by seven 4s, which would mean that the entire run is replaced, not just the first six. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is puzzling. Let's look for other patterns. \n\nAnother observation: the replacement is with 4s. But why 4? Maybe the replacement number is determined by the position in the array or the original number. But in all examples, regardless of the original number, the replacement is 4. So the key is the length of the run, not the value.\n\nWait, in the first example's third array, the 8s are replaced by 4s. In another array, 1s are replaced by 4s. So the value of the element doesn't matter; it's replaced by 4 regardless.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: in each array, replace every consecutive sequence of six or more identical elements with 4s. But then, in the 18th array, why is only part of the run replaced?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace runs of six or more elements with a number of 4s equal to the original run length. For example, if the run is seven elements long, replace them with seven 4s. Which would align with most examples, but the 18th array's case is conflicting.\n\nWait, in the 18th array's input, there's a run of ten 1s. The output shows seven 4s followed by three 1s. That would sum to ten elements, but why seven? Unless there's a typo in the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six elements. But then, the third array's seven 2s would not be replaced, which contradicts the example.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try another approach. Let's check other examples to see if there's a consistent rule.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input arrays. The third input array in Example 1's input is:\n\n[2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nSo the nine 6s are replaced by nine 4s, which aligns with the rule of replacing runs of six or more elements with 4s.\n\nAnother example in Example 1: the 17th input array (from Example 1's input):\n\n[8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[8,1,3,6,8,8,6,6,3,3,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,3,8,2,3,6,2,8,2]\n\nHere, the run of seven 8s (positions 13-19) is replaced by seven 4s. \n\nSo the pattern here is consistent: any consecutive run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s, regardless of the length. \n\nBut why then in Example 0's 18th array, the run of ten 1s is replaced by seven 4s followed by three 1s? That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the example data has a mistake. Because in the 18th array of Example 0's output, the input has ten 1s, and the output shows seven 4s followed by three 1s. That's a total of ten elements. So perhaps there's a typo in the example. Alternatively, perhaps there's another rule that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace the first six elements of a run of six or more with 4s. So, for a run of ten 1s, the first six become 4s, and the remaining four remain 1s. But in the output, it's seven 4s and three 1s. That adds up to ten. So that's not six. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is to replace runs of six or more with 4s, but only if the run starts at a certain position. For example, if the run starts at an even index. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is to replace the first occurrence of a run of six or more, but subsequent runs are left untouched. But in Example 0's third array, there are two runs replaced.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Let's try to look for other possible patterns. Maybe the transformation is not about consecutive elements but something else.\n\nLooking at the input and output arrays, perhaps the 4s are replacing a certain pattern of numbers. For example, maybe the sum of certain elements. But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is related to the position of the elements. Like, every sixth element is replaced with 4. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace every sixth occurrence of a number in the array. For example, after five instances, the sixth becomes 4. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output arrays. For each array in the examples, the output is the same as the input except that some consecutive sequences are replaced by 4s. The key is to determine which sequences are replaced.\n\nLet me take the third array of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1,8,3,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,3,2,3,3,6,6,2,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,3]\n\nSo the first run is from index 4 to 9 (six 8s) replaced by 4s. The second run is from index 20 to 26 (seven 2s) replaced by seven 4s. So both runs of six or more are replaced.\n\nIn the 18th array of Example 0, the input has a run of ten 1s starting at index 10. The output replaces indices 10-16 with 4s (seven elements), and indices 17-19 are 1s. That's ten elements total. So why seven 4s?\n\nWait, maybe the example has a typo. Let's check the user-provided example again.\n\nLooking back at Example 0's output:\n\nThe 18th array's output is:\n\n[2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nThe input's indices 10-19 are ten 1s. The output's indices 10-16 are seven 4s. Indices 17-19 are three 1s. But the original run is ten 1s. That suggests that the replacement was applied to seven elements. That's inconsistent with other examples. Unless there's a different rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of exactly seven elements. But that doesn't fit the other examples where runs of six are replaced. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of six or more, but the 4s are inserted, and the remaining elements are shifted. But that seems unlikely since the array lengths are the same.\n\nAt this point, I'm a bit stuck. The main pattern I see is that in most cases, runs of six or more identical elements are replaced with 4s. However, the 18th array's example contradicts this. Maybe the 18th array's example is an error, or perhaps there's an additional rule I'm missing.\n\nLet me try to see if there's another pattern. Maybe the replacement occurs only if the run is followed or preceded by certain numbers. Or maybe the position within the array matters. For instance, runs that start at even indices or something like that. But looking at the first example's third array, the run starts at index 4, which is even, and the replacement happens. The next run starts at index 20, which is even again. But in the 18th array's case, the run starts at index 10 (even), and yet only part is replaced. So that doesn't explain it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is applied to runs of six or more elements that are followed by a certain number. For example, if after the run there's a 3, then replace. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, the replacement is applied to runs of six or more elements where the run's number is even or odd. But in the first example, 8 is even, replaced. The second run is 2 (even), replaced. The 18th array's run is 1 (odd), but replaced. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is applied to runs of six or more elements except for the number 1. But in the 18th array, the 1s are replaced. So that's not the case.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples I've checked, the most consistent pattern seems to be replacing runs of six or more identical elements with 4s. Even though the 18th array's example is confusing, perhaps it's an error, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAssuming the rule is to replace any consecutive sequence of six or more identical elements with 4s, I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the test input. Let's look at each array in the test input and identify any runs of six or more identical elements, replacing them with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more. The first elements: 6,8,3,3,3,8... Not a run. Next, 8,3,3,3,8: no. Then 3,3,3: three in a row. 8,1,8,3,8,8,1: no. Later in the array: 3,1,1,1: three 1s. 2,2: two 2s. So no runs of six. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nSecond test array:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nLooking for runs. Let's see:\n\nAt positions 3 and 4: 8,8. Not enough. Then 8,8 again later (positions 10-11). Then 8,8,8 in positions 26-28: three 8s. Not six. So no runs. This array remains unchanged.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Starting from index 20: 2,1,1,1,1,1,1. That's six 1s (indices 21-26). So replace them with six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 4s from 21 to 26.\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. From index 21: seven 1s (indices 21-27). So replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 6-15: ten 8s (indices 6-15). So replace all with 4s.\n\nSixth test array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nPositions 6-15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, positions 22-26: five 1s (not enough).\n\nSeventh test array:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nIn positions 6-15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then positions 22-27: seven 8s (but in the array, it's indices 22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8. Six elements. So replace with six 4s.\n\nEighth test array:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nPositions 6-16: eleven 8s. Replace with 4s. \n\nNinth test array:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nPositions 6-15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Also, positions 17-19: three 8s (not enough).\n\nTenth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\n\nPositions 6-15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nEleventh test array:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\n\nPositions 5-14: ten 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, positions 25-27: three 1s.\n\nTwelfth test array:\n\n[6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\n\nLooking for runs. At positions 23-25: three 2s. Not enough. No runs of six. So remains unchanged.\n\nThirteenth test array:\n\n[1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 10-13: four 2s. Not enough. Other runs are short. No replacement.\n\nFourteenth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\n\nNo runs of six. So unchanged.\n\nFifteenth test array:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 6, 1, 1, 3]\n\nPositions 0-1: two 8s. Later, positions 13-14: two 1s. No runs of six. Unchanged.\n\nSixteenth test array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6]\n\nNo runs of six. Unchanged.\n\nSeventeenth test array:\n\n[3, 8, 1, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 20-22: three 8s. Not enough. Unchanged.\n\nEighteenth test array:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 6, 1]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nNineteenth test array:\n\n[3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 8]\n\nNo runs of six.\n\nTwentieth test array:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 0-2: three 8s. Then, positions 15-19: five 3s. Later, positions 20-25: six 3s (indices 20-25). So replace these six 3s with 4s.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 4s from indices 20 to 25.\n\nTwenty-first test array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 16-21: six 3s (indices 16-21). Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second test array:\n\n[8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test array:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 15-20: six 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fourth test array:\n\n[1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test array:\n\n[1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 16-22: seven 3s.

Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test array:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 14-18: five 3s. Not enough. But positions 13-19: seven 3s. So replace them with 4s.\n\nTwenty-eighth test array:\n\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 8-11: four 8s. Not enough. No runs.\n\nTwenty-ninth test array:\n\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\n\nLooking for runs.

Applying that rule to each array."
