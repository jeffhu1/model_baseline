        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of numbers, and the output is another list. The first thing I notice is that in some of the examples, certain sequences of numbers in the input are replaced with 4s in the output. For example, in Example 0, the third input line starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, ...], and the output becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 1, ...]. Similarly, in Example 1, the third input line has a sequence of six 6s which are replaced by 4s.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a consecutive sequence of the same number (maybe of a certain length?), those numbers are replaced by 4s. Let's check more examples. In Example 0's input, the third line has 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s), which become 4s. But in the first line of Example 0's input, there are three 8s in a row, and they remain 8s in the output. So maybe the threshold is 6? Like, sequences of 6 or more of the same number are replaced with 4s. Let's see other examples. In Example 1's input, the third line has six 6s which become 4s. Another example in Example 0: the input line [1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...] becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, ...], which suggests that even sequences longer than 6 are replaced by 4s, but only the first six? Or the entire run?\n\nWait, in Example 0's third input line, the input has 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) starting at position 4 (0-based index). The output replaces them with six 4s. So the entire run of six or more is replaced. Let's check another example. In Example 0's input, the line starting with [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, ...], the output is [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8, ...] but then later in the output there's a 4,4,4,4,4. Let's look at the input for that line: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]. Wait, the output for that line is [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]. So in the input, starting at position 22 (if we count from 0), there are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) which become four 4s? Wait, no, the output shows [...,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]. Wait, the input is [3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1], and the output is [3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]. Oh, so the run of six 3s (positions 22-27) becomes five 4s? Wait, maybe I'm counting wrong. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal input line (example 0, line 13):\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nLooking at the input, the sequence from position 22 to 27 (indices 22-27) is 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s). The output replaces them with 4,4,4,4,4 (five 4s) followed by a 3. Wait, that's five 4s and then a 3. But that's only replacing five of the six 3s. Hmm, that doesn't fit the earlier pattern. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six? Or perhaps the count is different. Let me check another example. In Example 0's input line 3: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, ...] becomes [1,2,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. So the six 8s are replaced by six 4s. That's a run of six, replaced by six 4s. So perhaps the rule is that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. Wait, but in the line 13 example, there's a run of six 3s replaced by five 4s and a 3. That doesn't fit. Unless maybe there's a different rule.\n\nWait, maybe the runs are longer than six. Let me check the input for line 13. The input is 3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3. Wait, the sequence starts at index 22: 3, then index 23 is 8, which breaks the run. Wait no, let me check again. The input for line 13 is:\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nSo positions 22 to 27 (indices 22-27) are 3,3,3,3,3,3. Oh wait, that's six 3s. So the output should replace them with six 4s. But the output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,3. Wait, that's five 4s and a 3. That contradicts the previous pattern. Hmm. So maybe there's a mistake in my observation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six, and if longer than six, only the first six are replaced? Let's check that. For example, in the input line 3, the run is six 8s, which are replaced by six 4s. In line 13's input, the run is six 3s, but in the output, it's five 4s and a 3. That's inconsistent. So maybe there's another aspect here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the output for line 13. The output is [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,1]. Wait, no, the output part is 4,4,4,4,4,1. So the original six 3s are replaced by five 4s and a 1? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that any run of exactly six identical numbers is replaced by 4s. But in line 13, perhaps the run is longer than six? Wait, no. The input is six 3s. So perhaps there's a different rule here. Maybe the position of the run matters, or maybe there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement occurs for runs of six or more, but only the first six are replaced. Wait, but in line 13, it's six 3s replaced by five 4s. That still doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe the problem is that I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal line 13 input (third line in example 0's output? Or maybe example 0's output is the first example's output. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the first example in the training data (Example 0) has input and output. The output for line 13 (the 14th line in the input list) is:\n\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1]\n\nWait, in the input, positions 22-27 are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s), but in the output, positions 22-27 are 4,4,4,4,4,3. So the first five 3s are replaced by 4s, and the sixth remains? That's confusing. So why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of five or more. Let me check other examples. For instance, in example 0's input line 2:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, the input has a run of six 8s (positions 4-9) replaced by six 4s. Then, a run of seven 2s (positions 20-26) replaced by seven 4s. So runs of six or more are replaced. But in line 13's example, a run of six 3s is replaced by five 4s and a 3. That's inconsistent. So perhaps there's an error in my observation here.\n\nWait, maybe the input for line 13 is different. Let me check again. The input for line 13 (as per the first example) is:\n\nInput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nSo the run of 3s starts at position 22 (index 22) and runs for six elements: indices 22 to 27 (inclusive) are 3,3,3,3,3,3. The output for this part is 4,4,4,4,4,3. So that's five 4s and a 3. That's not replacing the entire run. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the replacement is triggered by a run of six, but only if it's preceded and followed by a different number. For example, in line 2, the six 8s are between 1 and 1, which are different. So they get replaced. But in line 13's case, the run of six 3s is followed by an 8. So the entire run is six 3s followed by an 8. Then why is the output five 4s and a 3? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement starts after a certain position. Like, maybe the replacement is only applied to runs starting from a certain index. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the test input provided. The test input has several lines. For example, the third line of the test input is:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nHere, there's a run of six 1s from positions 21 to 26 (indices 21-26). According to the pattern observed in the training examples, this run should be replaced with six 4s. So the output for this line would have 4s there.\n\nAnother test line: the fourth line of the test input is [1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]. Here, positions 20-26 have seven 1s. So this should be replaced by seven 4s.\n\nBut how does this apply to the training examples? Let's go back to the line 13 example. The input has six 3s, but the output only replaces five of them. That's confusing. Unless perhaps there's a mistake in my observation. Let me recheck the input and output for line 13 in Example 0.\n\nOriginal input line (example 0, line 13 in input):\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOutput line (example 0, line 13 in output):\n\n[8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nWait, the original run is six 3s (positions 22-27) in the input. The output has five 4s and then a 1. So positions 22-26 are 4s, and position 27 is 1. That's different from the input. But why?\n\nHmm. This suggests that maybe the pattern isn't just replacing runs of six. There must be another condition. Let's look for more examples.\n\nLooking at example 0's input line 17:\n\nInput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,8,3,1,2,3]\n\nHere, the input has a run of seven 1s (positions 10-16: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1). The output replaces them with seven 4s. So runs of seven are replaced. So why in line 13's case, a run of six is not fully replaced?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is for runs of exactly six, but in some cases, the run is longer, and the replacement is for the first six. But in line 17's input, the run is seven 1s, replaced by seven 4s, which would mean that the entire run is replaced regardless of length.\n\nAnother example: in example 0's input line 18:\n\nInput: [2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nOutput: [2,1,2,1,8,2,3,2,6,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nHere, the input has ten 1s starting at position 10. The output replaces the first seven with 4s and leaves the next three as 1s. Wait, no: in the input, positions 10-19 are ten 1s. The output replaces positions 10-16 (seven 1s) with seven 4s, and positions 17-19 remain 1s. So that's replacing seven 1s with 4s, and leaving three. So that's a run of ten 1s, replaced by seven 4s. This suggests that the replacement is only for runs of seven or more? But in previous examples, runs of six were replaced.\n\nThis is conflicting. Let's look at line 17 again. The input has seven 1s, replaced by seven 4s. Line 18's input has ten 1s, but the output replaces the first seven with 4s and leaves the last three. So that's confusing. Why would the first seven be replaced but not the rest?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement applies to the first occurrence of a run of six or more, and others are left as is. Or maybe the replacement is done in a different way. Maybe the run has to be exactly six or more, and the entire run is replaced by 4s. But in line 18's case, the output only replaced seven of ten. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my observation. Let me check line 18's input and output again.\n\nInput line 18 (example 0):\n\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1]\n\nOutput line 18:\n\n[2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 2, 6, 8, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,3,6,2,1,2,2,2,3,3,1]\n\nThe input has ten 1s starting at index 10 (positions 10-19). The output replaces the first seven 1s (indices 10-16) with 4s and leaves the next three 1s (indices 17-19) as 1s. So why is that? The run is ten 1s, but only the first seven are replaced. That suggests that the rule is to replace runs of seven or more, but only the first seven? Or perhaps the rule is that runs of exactly seven are replaced, but longer runs are only partially replaced. This is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the numbers are replaced when they form a group of six, but there's some other condition like their position in the list. For example, in the first few lines of the input, the replacement occurs after a certain position. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input and see if applying the replacement of six or more consecutive numbers with 4s would generate the expected output. For example, in the third line of the test input:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nThe sequence from position 21 to 26 is six 1s. If we replace them with six 4s, the output for this line should have those six 1s replaced by 4s. Similarly, in the fourth test input line:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nHere, positions 20-26 are seven 1s. So they would be replaced by seven 4s.\n\nBut why in some training examples, like line 13, a run of six is only partially replaced. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in how I'm counting. Let me check line 13 again.\n\nOriginal input line 13 (example 0):\n\nInput: [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 6, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1]\n\nOutput line 13:\n\n[8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,1]\n\nThe input has six 3s from index 22-27 (0-based). The output replaces those six positions with five 4s and a 3. But why? Unless there's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, perhaps the replacement is not for all consecutive runs but only for runs in specific contexts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of the same number that are part of a larger pattern. For example, if the run is followed by another run of the same number. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the position of the run in the list. For instance, the first half of the list is treated differently. But looking at the training examples, this doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAnother angle: looking for other transformations. Maybe the 4s are not just replacing runs but something else. For example, the sum of the numbers, or some other operation. But the examples show that the replaced numbers are consecutive and the same, replaced by 4s.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input line 3:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nHere, the input has nine 6s starting at position 5 (indices 5-13). The output replaces all nine with 4s. So that's a run of nine, replaced by nine 4s. So the rule must be that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by the same number of 4s.\n\nBut then, why in line 13 of Example 0's input, the six 3s are replaced by five 4s and a 3? That's a contradiction unless there's a mistake in the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is not for all runs but only for runs that start at a certain position. Or maybe the replacement is only for the first such run in the list.\n\nLooking at line 13's input again:\n\nInput: [8,8,2,8,8,6,8,6,3,8,6,1,3,2,8,3,6,6,2,6,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1]\n\nThe run of six 3s starts at position 22. The output replaces the first five with 4s and leaves the sixth as 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Or maybe the run is not six but five. Let's count again: positions 22-27 are 3,3,3,3,3,3. That's six 3s. The output has 4,4,4,4,4,3. So five 4s and one 3. That's six elements replaced. So maybe there's a mistake in the example. Or perhaps the rule is that runs of six or more are replaced, but the first five are 4s and the rest remain. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern. For instance, the replacement occurs for runs of six or more, but the replacement starts after a certain number. For example, the first two elements of the run are kept, then the next six replaced. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is triggered when the run is exactly six, and for longer runs, the entire run is replaced. But in line 13's case, the run is exactly six, so why isn't it replaced?\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing. Perhaps the correct pattern is that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s, and the number of 4s is equal to the length of the run. If that's the case, then line 13's output must have six 4s. But according to the example, it's five 4s and a 3. So this suggests that either there's a mistake in the example, or my understanding is incorrect.\n\nBut given that most examples follow the pattern of replacing runs of six or more with 4s, perhaps I should proceed with that assumption and apply it to the test input. It's possible that the line 13 example is an exception, but perhaps there's a different rule I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of five or more. Let's check another example. In Example 0's line 2, the run of six 8s is replaced by six 4s. Another example in line 3: six 8s replaced by six 4s. Line 18: ten 1s replaced by seven 4s. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe the correct rule is that runs of six or more are replaced by 4s, but only the first six are replaced. But in line 18, ten 1s are replaced by seven 4s, which contradicts that.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Another possibility: the replacement is done for runs of the number 8, or another specific number. But in the examples, runs of different numbers (like 1s, 3s, 6s, etc.) are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is for runs of numbers greater than or equal to 6. But in the examples, the replaced numbers include 8s, 3s, 2s, etc.\n\nAnother angle: look at the positions where replacements happen. For example, in the first example's output, the replaced runs are in the middle of the list. Maybe the replacement is based on the position of the run. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is only for runs that are preceded by a certain number. For example, in the third line of example 0's input, the run of 8s is preceded by 1. But this doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the replacement is applied only to the first run of six or more in each list. For example, in line 13's case, there's another run earlier in the list. Let's check.\n\nIn line 13's input: the run of six 3s is the only run of six or more. So why is it not replaced fully? Unless there's another condition. This is perplexing.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to assume that any run of six or more identical numbers is replaced by 4s of the same length. Even if there's an exception in line 13, which may be a typo or a mistake in the example. But given that all other examples follow this rule, I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, for the test input, I'll look for runs of six or more identical numbers and replace them with 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first test input line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nChecking for runs of six or more. The first few numbers are 6,8,3,3,3,8: no run. Then there's 1,8,3,8,8,1: no run. So this line has no runs of six or more. So output is the same as input.\n\nSecond test input line:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nNo runs of six or more. So output same.\n\nThird test input line:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nHere, positions 21-26 (0-based) are six 1s. Replace with six 4s.\n\nFourth test input line:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nPositions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nFifth test input line:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nHere, positions 6-15: ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Also, positions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nWait, the input is [8,1,2,3,8,6, followed by eight 8s (positions 6-15?), then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (assuming commas are correct). Let me count correctly:\n\nThe input line is:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nSo from position 6 (0-based) to position 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). So this is a run of ten 8s. Replace with ten 4s. Then, positions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s. So the output line would have ten 4s starting at position 6, and seven 4s starting at position 20.\n\nContinuing this process for all test input lines. Each line is processed by replacing any run of six or more identical numbers with 4s of the same length. Other numbers remain the same."
