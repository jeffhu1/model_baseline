        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern here. The task is to transform the input lists into the output lists based on the training examples provided. Let's start by looking at the first training example.\n\nIn Example 0, the input and output arrays look similar except for some sequences being replaced by 4s. Let's take the third input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm, so the sequence of 8s starting from index 4 to 9 (six elements) becomes 4s. Similarly, the sequence of 2s starting at index 20 (seven elements) becomes 4s. Wait, but in the output, the first replaced part is six 4s and the next is seven 4s. The original numbers here were all the same (8s and 2s). So maybe the pattern is replacing runs of six or more identical numbers with 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nLooking at the fourth input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nAgain, the run of six 8s starting at index 4 becomes fours, and the seven 2s starting at index 20 become fours. So the rule might be: any consecutive sequence of six or more of the same number is replaced by the number 4, repeated the same number of times as the original sequence. Let's check another example to confirm.\n\nIn Example 1's first input array:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the sequence of nine 6s starting at index 5 is replaced by nine 4s. So the pattern seems consistent. The key is that whenever there's a consecutive run of six or more of the same number, replace each element in that run with 4. Other elements remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's check the test input. The first test input line is:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of six or more. Let's scan through each element:\n\n6,8,3,3,3,8: no run here. Then 1,8,3,8,8,1: no. Next 6,3,1,2,3,1: no. Then 1,1,1: three 1s. Then 3,1,2,2: two 2s. Then 6,8,2,3,8,6. So no runs of six. So the first test input line's output should be the same as input.\n\nBut wait, looking at the fifth test input line:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nHere, starting from index 6 (assuming 0-based indexing), there are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's ten 8s. So this entire run should be replaced with ten 4s. Similarly, the next part after 1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1: that's five 1s, so not enough. The 1s at indices 21-25 (six elements: 1,1,1,1,1,1) wait, no, let's recount the indices. The array is:\n\nIndices 0-5: [6,1,3,1,8,6]\nThen indices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 elements)\nThen indices 16-25: 1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1 (from index 16: 1, index 17:1, 18:3, 19:1, 20:6, 21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1. So from 21 to 25: five 1s. So not a run of six. The 8s from index6 to15 (10 elements) would be replaced by 4s.\n\nSo the fifth test input line's output should have 10 4s starting at index6.\n\nApplying this to all test input lines: for each line, find consecutive runs of six or more of the same number, replace each element in those runs with 4. The rest stay the same.\n\nNow, let's check each line in the test input.\n\nFirst line:\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\nNo runs of six or more. So output same as input.\n\nSecond line:\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\nCheck for runs. The 8,8,8 at the end are three, so no. Other parts: 6,6 is two; 3,3 is two. So output same.\n\nThird line:\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\nLooking for runs. The part starting at index21: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace these six with 4s. So indices21-26 become 4s. So the output here would have six 4s there.\n\nFourth line:\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\nLooking at indices20-26: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). Replace with 4s. So seven 4s here.\n\nFifth line:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\nCheck for runs. The 8s start at index6. From index6 to index15: 8 repeated 10 times. Replace with 4s. Then from index20-26: seven 1s. Replace with 4s. So two runs here.\n\nSixth line:\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\nAs discussed earlier, the 8s from index6-15 (10 elements) become 4s. The next part: 1s from index21-25 (five 1s) not enough. The 1,1,3,1,6,1, etc. No other runs. So only the 8s replaced.\n\nSeventh line:\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\nLooking for runs. The first four 3s (indices0-3) are four, so no. Then the 8s from index6-15: 10 elements. Replace with 4s. Then the 8s again at indices22-27: six elements. Replace those with 4s.\n\nWait, the input here is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. Let's count:\n\nIndices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 8s) \u2192 replaced by 4s.\n\nThen indices22-27: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s) \u2192 replaced by 4s. So in the output, those positions become six 4s.\n\nEighth line:\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\nThe 8s from index6 to16: that's 11 elements. So replace all with 4s.\n\nNinth line:\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\nCheck for runs. The 8s from index6-15 (10 elements) replaced by 4s. Then at indices17-19: 8,8,8 (three) so no. Then the 3,3 at the end: no. So replace the first run.\n\nTenth line:\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\nThe 8s from index6-15: 10 elements \u2192 4s. Then the 8,8,8 at the end (indices26-28) \u2192 three, so no.\n\nEleventh line:\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\nThe 8s from index5-14: 10 elements. Then from index15-15 (assuming the next 8s). Wait, let's check the input line:\n\nInput indices5-14: starting at 5 (assuming 0-based), which is 8, then 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions5-14 is 10 elements). Then index15 is 8 again. So from 5 to15, that's 11 8s. So replace all 11 with 4s. Also, the 1s at indices25-27: three 1s. No replacement there.\n\nTwelfth line:\n[6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\nCheck for runs. The 2s at indices8-9: two. Then the 3,3 at 20-21: two. The 2s at the end (indices27-29): three. No runs of six.\n\nThirteenth line:\n[1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 6]\nCheck runs. The 2,2,2,2 at indices10-13: four.

No replacements.\n\nFourteenth line:\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\nNo runs of six.\n\nFifteenth line:\n[8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 6, 1, 1, 3]\nCheck for runs.

The 8,8,8 at start: three. Then the 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices10-15: six 3s. Replace with 4s. Also, the 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices16-19: four 3s? Wait, let's count:\n\nIndices10-15: 3,3,3,3 (assuming the input is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Wait, the input line is:\n\n[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8]\n\nAt indices10-13: 3,3,3,3 (four). Then index14 is 6.

So replace indices15-20 with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-first line:\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices16-21: six 3s. Replace with 4s. Also, the 8,8,8 at the end (indices24-26): three. No.\n\nTwenty-second line:\n[8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 8, 2, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1]\nCheck for runs. The 8,8 at indices6-7: two. The 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-third line:\n[2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 6, 3, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices16-21: six 3s. Replace with six 4s. The 8,8,8 at indices10-12: three. No.\n\nTwenty-fourth line:\n[1, 1, 3, 6, 6, 3, 2, 2, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices16-22: seven 3s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth line:\n[1, 3, 6, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 2]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices16-22: seven 3s \u2192 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth line:\n[8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6]\nCheck for runs. The 2,2,2,2 at indices6-9: four. The 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3 at indices14-21: eight 3s \u2192 replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh line:\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3,3,3 at indices14-18: five. The 8,8 at the end: two. No.\n\nTwenty-eighth line:\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\nCheck for runs. The 8,8,8,8 at indices8-11: four. No.\n\nTwenty-ninth line:\n[1, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 8, 1, 6, 2, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8]\nCheck for runs. The 3,3,3,3 at indices6-9: four. No.\n\nThirtieth line:\n[8, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 3, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 8]\nCheck for runs. The 8,8 at indices7-8: two. No.\n\nSo for each test input line, wherever there's a consecutive run of six or more of the same number, replace each element in that run with 4. The rest stays the same."
