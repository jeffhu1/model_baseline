        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input is a list of numbers, and the output is a modified list where some sequences of numbers are replaced with 4's. \n\nFirst, I need to compare the input and output for each example to see where the 4's appear. Let's start with Example 0. The input has a part like [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8] which in the output becomes [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. Wait, actually in Example 0, the third input line is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, ...] and the output becomes [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, ...]. So it looks like a run of six 8's is replaced by six 4's. But wait, in the output, the six 8's are replaced by six 4's. Similarly, in the same example, later there's a run of seven 2's that becomes seven 4's. So maybe the rule is that consecutive numbers that repeat exactly six or more times are replaced by 4's for the entire run? Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the third input line is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, ...], and the output is [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, ...]. Here, nine 6's are replaced by nine 4's. So the pattern seems to be that any consecutive sequence of the same number that is six or longer is replaced by the same number of 4's. But wait, in Example 0's third input line, the run is six 8's, which becomes six 4's. In another part of Example 0, the input has seven 2's, which become seven 4's. So the rule is: replace any consecutive run of 6 or more identical numbers with 4's, keeping the same length.\n\nBut wait, in Example 0's first two input lines, there are runs that are exactly three or maybe two, but in the output they are unchanged. For example, the first input line in Example 0 starts with [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...], and the output is the same. The three 8's here are three, which is less than six, so they stay. Then in the third line, the six 8's become six 4's. So the threshold is six or more consecutive same numbers. So the transformation is: whenever there's a consecutive sequence of the same number that's 6 or longer, replace each element in that sequence with a 4.\n\nLet me check another example to confirm. In Example 1's input, the third line has a run of nine 6's, which are all replaced by 4's. Another example in Example 1's input: the line starting with [3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 2, 2, 2, 6, 3, ...] becomes in the output [...] and then the 8's in the input that are part of a longer run. Wait, maybe looking at the input and output of Example 1, another input line is [3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 2, 2, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, ...], and the output replaces the seven 8's with seven 4's. So yes, that's the pattern.\n\nSo the rule is: in each list, scan from left to right. Whenever you find a consecutive run of the same number that is 6 or longer, replace each of those numbers with a 4. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's take each of the test input lists and look for runs of 6 or more same numbers. Let's go through each line one by one.\n\nFirst test input line: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]. Scanning through, the longest consecutive runs are 3,3,3 (length 3), 8,8 (length 2), etc. So no runs of 6, so this line remains unchanged.\n\nSecond line: [1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]. Again, the longest runs are of 2 or 3, so no changes.\n\nThird line: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]. Here, the sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1] (six 1's) needs to be replaced with six 4's. So from index 21 to 26 (assuming 0-based), those 1's become 4's.\n\nFourth line: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]. The run from index 20 to 26 is seven 1's. Replace with seven 4's.\n\nFifth line: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The sequence starting at 6: eight 8's (positions 6 to 15, maybe) are a run of 10 8's. So replace all of those with 4's. Then later, the seven 1's (positions 19-25) become seven 4's. Wait, positions 6 to 15: the elements are 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (10 in a row), so replace all with 4's. Then the next part is 1,3,8,1, then seven 1's (positions 19-25?), which would become seven 4's. Then the rest remains.\n\nSixth line: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The 8's from index 6 to 15: 10 in a row. Replace with 4's. Then there's a run of 5 1's (index 21-25?) which is 5, so no. Then the 6 at index 26 is single. So only the 8's become 4's.\n\nSeventh line: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. The first four 3's (length 4) stay. Then the 8's from index 4: 8, then 3, then from index 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (8's starting at 6 to 15, maybe 10 in a row). Replace those with 4's. Then later, from index 22 to 27: eight 8's. Replace with 4's. So both runs of 8's longer than 6 are replaced.\n\nEighth line: [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. The 8's from index 6 to 16: 11 in a row. Replace with 4's. Then at the end, three 8's: not enough.\n\nNinth line: [1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]. The 8's from index 6 to 15: 10 in a row. Replace with 4's. Then the three 8's at 18-20 are not enough. The 8's after are single.\n\nTenth line: [8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]. The 8's from index 6 to 15: 10, replace with 4's. Then three 8's at the end, so no.\n\nEleventh line: [3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]. The 8's from index 5 to 14: 10 in a row. Replace with 4's. Then three 1's at the end (length 3) stay.\n\nTwelfth line: [6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]. No runs of 6 here. The 3,3 is two, 2,2 is two, 2,2,2 at the end is three. So no changes.\n\nThirteenth line: [1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]. The 2,2,2,2 (four) and 3,3,3 (three) are under six. No changes.\n\nFourteenth line: [8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]. 3,3 (two), 6,6 (two), 3,3 (two). No changes.\n\nFifteenth line: [8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]. The 8,8 at start (two), 1,1 (two), 3,3,3 (three), 8,8,8 (three), 3,3,3 (three), 1,1 (two). No runs of six.\n\nSixteenth line: [6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]. The 3,3,3 (three), 8,8 (two), 3,3,3 (three), etc. No changes.\n\nSeventeenth line: [3,8,1,1,8,2,3,3,2,8,1,6,1,6,6,8,6,3,1,8,3,8,8,8,1,1,6,3,3,1]. The 8,8,8 (three) stays.\n\nEighteenth line: [8,8,1,2,3,6,3,3,1,8,8,3,3,6,8,1,8,1,2,2,3,8,3,8,8,2,6,8,6,1]. The 8,8 (two), no changes.\n\nNineteenth line: [3,1,8,2,3,3,6,3,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,1,3,1,8,2,8,1,1,2,1,3,3,8]. No runs of six.\n\nTwentieth line: [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Here, the 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six) at positions 11-16 (if 0-based) becomes six 4's. Also, the three 8's at the start (three) stay. Then later 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six) would be replaced.\n\nWait, the input line is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Let's check the runs:\n\n- 8,8,8 (three) \u2192 remains.\n- Then 3,3,3,3 (four) starting at index 10? Wait, let's see the sequence:\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\nIndices (assuming 0-based):\n\n0:8, 1:8, 2:8 \u2192 run of 3 \u2192 stays.\n\nThen 1, 2, etc. Let's see after that:\n\nAt index 7:3, then 8, then 3. Wait, perhaps the 3's start at index 9: the input is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. Let's break it down:\n\n- 0-2: 8,8,8 \u2192 run of 3 \u2192 stays.\n\n- 3:1 \u2192 single.\n\n- 4:2 \u2192 single.\n\n-5-6:8,8 \u2192 run of 2 \u2192 stays.\n\n-7:3 \u2192 single.\n\n-8-9:1,1 \u2192 run of 2 \u2192 stays.\n\n-10-13:3,3,3,3 \u2192 run of 4 \u2192 stays.\n\n-14:6 \u2192 single.\n\n-15-20:3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 run of 6 \u2192 replace with 4's.\n\nSo in this line, the six 3's from index 15 to 20 become six 4's. The four 3's earlier (indices 10-13) are not long enough.\n\nThen the rest of the line is as is.\n\nNext line: [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. The run of six 3's starting at index 15-20 (assuming) would be replaced with 4's. Wait, let's look:\n\nThe list is [6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]. Let's check the 3's:\n\nAt index 2:3.\n\nThen index 7:3.\n\nThen index 9:3.\n\nAt 12-13:3,3.\n\nThen index 14:1.\n\nThen 15-20:3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 six in a row. So replace those with 4's.\n\nThen the rest:8,2,8,8,8 (three 8's), etc. So the six 3's become 4's.\n\nNext line: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]. The run of seven 3's from index 16-22 (maybe). Let's check the sequence:\n\nLooking at the input line: [8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]. The 3's start at index 3 (single), then index 10 (3), index 13 (3), index 15-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 (seven 3's). So replace those seven with 4's.\n\nNext line: [2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]. The run at indices 15-20: six 3's. Replace with 4's. Then the 8,8,8 (three) remains.\n\nNext line: [1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]. The 3's from index 16-22: seven in a row.

The 3's from indices 16-22: seven 3's \u2192 4's.\n\nNext line: [8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]. The 3's from index 13-20: eight 3's \u2192 replaced with 4's.\n\nNext line: [3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]. The 3's at indices 8-12: three 3's, then later 3,3,3,3,3 (five). No runs of six.\n\nNext line: [6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]. The 8,8,8,8 (four) \u2192 remains.\n\nNext line: [1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]. The 3,3,3,3 (four) \u2192 remains.\n\nLast line: [8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]. The 3's at the end (three) \u2192 remains.\n\nSo for each test input line, we need to go through and replace any consecutive runs of six or more same numbers with 4's of the same length. All other numbers stay the same."
