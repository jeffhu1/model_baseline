        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out the pattern in the training examples and apply it to the test input. Let me look at the examples first.\n\nIn Example 0, looking at the input and output arrays, I notice that some elements are replaced with 4s. Let's compare the input and output for a few rows. Take the third input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHere, in the input, there's a sequence of six 8s starting at position 4, which in the output becomes six 4s. Then later, there's a sequence of seven 2s starting at position 20, which becomes seven 4s. So sequences of the same number longer than a certain length are replaced with 4s?\n\nLooking at another example in the same training input. Let's take the fourth input array:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\nOutput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\n\nAgain, the six 8s become six 4s, and seven 2s become seven 4s. So the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a consecutive run of the same number that is 6 or longer, those numbers are replaced with 4s. Let me check another example to confirm.\n\nLooking at the seventh input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 6]\nOutput: [1, 3, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 8, 6]\n\nWait, here the input has seven 8s starting at position 4. The output replaces the first six with 4s, but the seventh remains 8. Hmm, that's conflicting. Or maybe the replacement is for runs of exactly six? Wait, in the input, the run is seven 8s. The output replaces them with six 4s followed by the original 8? Or maybe the rule is that any run of six or more, the entire run is replaced with 4s. Wait in the output here, the seventh 8 is replaced with 4 as well. Wait the input is seven 8s. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input part: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (positions 4-10). The output is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4. So all seven 8s are replaced with 4s. So maybe the rule is: any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s. Then, the length of the replacement is the same as the original run. So, if there's a run of 6, replace all with 4s. If the run is 7, replace all 7 with 4s.\n\nBut wait in Example 0's first input array, the input is:\n\n[3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]\n\nThe output is the same as the input. Looking at this, there's a run of three 8s (positions 6-8), which isn't replaced. A run of five 3s (positions 10-14) which is also not replaced. So the replacement only happens when the run is 6 or longer. So the threshold is 6.\n\nNow looking at Example 1. For instance, the third input array in Example 1:\n\nInput: [2,3,8,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,2,6,6,2,8,3,8,8,3,2,3,3,3,2]\n\nThe input has nine 6s (positions 5-13). In the output, they are all replaced with 4s. So again, any run of 6 or more same numbers becomes 4s.\n\nNow, looking at the test input. Let's take the fourth test input array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The part starting at position 6 (assuming 0-based index?) Let's check:\n\nFrom index 6 (value 8) up to index 15: that's 10 consecutive 8s. So this run should be replaced with 4s. Similarly, in the same array, positions 20-26 (assuming 0-based) are seven 1s. That's another run to replace with 4s.\n\nAnother test input array:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs: the first four 3s (positions 0-3) are four in a row, which is less than 6. Then from position 4 (8) but then position 5 is 3, which breaks. Then from position 5 (3) to ... wait no. Wait the array is [3,3,3,3,8,3, ...]. So the 3s are positions 0-3 (4 elements), then a single 3 at position 5. Then after that, positions 6-15 are 8s. Let's count: from position 6 (8) to 15 (8) is 10 elements. So that's a run of 10 8s. So replace all with 4s. Then, later in the array, from position 22 (8) to 27 (8) is six 8s. So that's another run to replace with 4s. The last part of the array: positions 27-28 are 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s?), but need to check exact indices. Wait the array given is:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nSo the part after 6,2 is positions 22-27 (assuming 0-based). Positions 22:8, 23:8, ..., 27:8. That's 6 elements (positions 22 to 27 inclusive). So that's a run of 6 8s, which should be replaced with 4s.\n\nSo the approach is: for each array in the test input, scan for consecutive runs of the same number of length 6 or more, and replace all elements in those runs with 4s.\n\nNow, I need to apply this to all the test input arrays. Let's go through each array in the test input and identify the runs.\n\nLet me start with the first test array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more same numbers. Let's check each sequence:\n\n6,8,3,3,3: three 3s. Next is 8: no run. Then 1,8,3,8,8: 2 8s. Then 1,6, etc. Then 3,1,1,1: three 1s. Then 3,1: etc. 2,2: two 2s. So no runs of 6. So this array remains unchanged.\n\nThe output array should be the same as the input.\n\nSecond test array:\n\n[1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck for runs. 6,6: two 6s. 8,8: two 8s. 3,3: two. 8,8: two. 8,8: two. 8,8,8: three. No runs of 6. So output same as input.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence starting at position 21: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace them with six 4s. The rest of the array has no runs of 6. So in the output array, positions 21-26 (assuming 0-based) would be 4s.\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs. At positions 20-26: seven 1s. Replace with 4s. So from index 20 to 26 (inclusive), seven 4s.\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nCheck for runs. Starting at position 6 (0-based) is a run of 10 8s (positions 6-15). Replace with 4s. Then at positions 20-26: seven 1s, replace with 4s. So those parts become 4s.\n\nSixth test array:\n\n[6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nRun of 8s from positions 6-15: 10 8s \u2192 replace with 4s. Then positions 21-25: five 1s (but that's only five, so no). Position 22-26 (1,1,1,1,1,6) \u2192 five 1s. So only the 8s are replaced.\n\nSeventh test array:\n\n[3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nThe first four 3s (positions 0-3) are four, so no. Then from position 6-15: 10 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s. Then positions 22-27: six 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nEighth test array:\n\n[3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]\n\nRun of 8s from position 6-16: 11 8s \u2192 replaced with 4s.\n\nNinth test array:\n\n[1,8,3,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,2,8,3,1,3,3,6,1,3,1]\n\nRun of 8s from positions 6-15: 10 8s. Then positions 17-19: three 8s. So only the first run is replaced.\n\nTenth test array:\n\n[8,1,2,3,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,6,6,1,3,8,3,3,2,8,8,8,1]\n\nRun of 8s from positions 6-15: 10 \u2192 4s.\n\nEleventh test array:\n\n[3,3,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,1,8,1,8,6,2,8,1,1,1,6,3]\n\nRun of 8s from positions 5-14: 10 8s. Then positions 15-16: another 8, making the run 11. So all replaced with 4s.\n\nTwelfth test array:\n\n[6,1,1,2,1,6,8,3,2,2,8,1,6,3,8,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,6,1,2,8,6,2,2,2]\n\nCheck for runs. The only possible run is the two 2s at the end (positions 27-29: three 2s). So no replacement. Output same as input.\n\nThirteenth test array:\n\n[1,3,2,8,1,2,8,8,1,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,2,1,1,6,6,3,8,3,3,1,6]\n\nCheck for runs. The four 2s (positions 10-13) are four, so no. The three 3s (positions 14-16) are three. No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nFourteenth test array:\n\n[8,1,2,6,3,1,3,2,8,1,3,3,8,1,8,3,6,6,8,3,1,8,1,3,3,2,3,3,6,3]\n\nNo runs of 6. So output same.\n\nFifteenth test array:\n\n[8,8,1,3,2,8,1,1,2,1,2,1,8,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,1,8,6,1,1,3]\n\nCheck for runs. The three 8s at the start (positions 0-1: two 8s). Then later three 8s (positions 18-20: three). No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nSixteenth test array:\n\n[6,8,3,2,8,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,8,3,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,1,3,6,3,2,8,6]\n\nNo runs of 6.

Output same.\n\nTwentieth test array:\n\n[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nCheck for runs. The sequence starting at position 10: 3,3,3,3,6. Wait, no. Wait the array is:\n\n[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]\n\nAt positions 10-15: 3,3,3,3,6,3 \u2192 not a run. Then positions 15-20: 3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 six 3s. So replace those six 3s with 4s. So positions 15-20 (0-based) would be 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test array:\n\n[6,8,3,8,1,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,1,1]\n\nLooking for runs. The sequence from position 16-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 six 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-second test array:\n\n[8,1,6,3,1,2,8,8,1,1,3,8,2,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,1,3,1]\n\nCheck for runs. From position 15-21: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 \u2192 seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-third test array:\n\n[2,1,2,2,1,8,6,3,1,3,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,1,3,1,1,3,2,6]\n\nCheck for runs. Positions 15-20: six 3s. Replace with 4s. Then positions 21-22: 8,8 \u2192 two, so no. Then later 3,1,1,3: no.\n\nTwenty-fourth test array:\n\n[1,1,3,6,6,3,2,2,8,2,6,3,8,6,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,3,3,3]\n\nPositions 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-fifth test array:\n\n[1,3,6,1,8,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,8,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,8,3,3,8,1,2]\n\nPositions 16-22: seven 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nTwenty-sixth test array:\n\n[8,8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,1,6,1,8,6,8,6]\n\nCheck for runs. The part starting at position 4: 2,2,2,2 \u2192 four 2s. Then positions 10-11: 8,8. Then positions 13-20: eight 3s. So replace those eight 3s with 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test array:\n\n[3,3,1,1,1,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,8,8,2,2,8,1,1,2,1,8,8]\n\nCheck for runs. Positions 13-17: five 3s. Then positions 18-19: 3,6. No. So no runs of 6. Output same.\n\nTwenty-eighth test array:\n\n[6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,1,3,6,8,3,3,8,1,1,1,6,1,2,6,2,6,3,8]\n\nCheck for runs. The four 8s (positions 8-11). No. So output same.\n\nTwenty-ninth test array:\n\n[1,2,8,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,6,6,1,8,1,6,2,1,6,3,3,3,8,3,8,1,8]\n\nNo runs of 6. Output same.\n\nThirtieth test array:\n\n[8,6,2,6,3,8,2,8,8,3,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,8,1,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,3,3,8]\n\nCheck for runs. The sequence 8,8,3: two 8s. No. So output same.\n\nSo applying this to all test arrays. For each array, replace any consecutive run of 6 or more same numbers with 4s. The rest remain the same."
