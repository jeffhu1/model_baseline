        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the input lists and their corresponding outputs in the training examples and find out what transformation is applied. Then apply that to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output have the same elements except some sequences are replaced with 4s. Let me check the first input and output. The third line of the input in Example 0 starts with [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, ...], and the output is [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, ...]. So the sequence of six 8s is replaced with six 4s. Similarly, in the next line, the input has eight 8s (positions 5-10) which become six 4s. Wait, wait, the output for that line is [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, ...]. So the original input here is [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, ...], so the six 8s starting at position 5 (indices 4 to 9) are replaced with six 4s. So the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number, they are replaced with 4s. Let me check another example.\n\nIn Example 1, looking at the third line of input: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, ...]. The output for this line is [2,3,8,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,...]. So here, the consecutive 6s (nine in total) are replaced with 4s. So that's a run longer than 6. Wait, the output replaces them with 4s for the same count as the original run? Wait, in Example 0's third line input, there were six 8s, and they became six 4s. In Example 1's third line input, there are nine 6s, and they become nine 4s. So the transformation is replacing any run of 6 or more of the same number with 4s, but keeping the same length of the run. So the rule is: whenever there is a consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each of them with 4, but keep the length of the sequence the same.\n\nLooking at other examples to confirm. Take another line in Example 0's input: the fourth input line is [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, ...], and the output is [1,3,8,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,...]. Again, six 8s become six 4s. So the threshold is 6 or more consecutive numbers. So any run of 6+ same numbers gets replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nNow check if there are any exceptions. Let's look at another example. In Example 0's input, the first line of input is [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,...], and the output is the same as input. Because the 3s are in runs of 2, then 1, then 5, etc. Wait, in the first input line: the 8s are three in a row (positions 6-8), which is less than 6, so they remain. The next part has 3s: 3,3,3,3,3 (five in a row?), wait looking at the input: [3,3,2,6,3,6,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,1,2,2,6,3,3,2,8,1,1]. The 3s after the first 8s: positions 10-14 are five 3s. So that's a run of 5, which is less than 6, so they stay as 3s. But in the output, they are still 3s. So the pattern only applies when the run is 6 or longer.\n\nIn Example 0's third input line, there's a run of 8s starting at position 4 (index 4) with six 8s, which becomes six 4s. Then later in the same line, after that, there's a run of seven 2s starting at position 20 (index 20?), which in the output becomes seven 4s. Wait, the input is [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]. So after the six 8s (positions 4-9, indexes 4-9?), the 2s start at position 20 (index 20?), which is 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 (seven 2s). The output for that part is 4,4,4,4,4,4,4. So yes, seven 2s become seven 4s.\n\nSo the rule is: any consecutive run of 6 or more of the same number is replaced by 4s of the same length.\n\nNow, check if this applies to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input lines. Let's take the third line of test input:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. The part starting at position 21 (assuming 0-based index) is 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So this should be replaced by six 4s.\n\nAnother test line: fifth line of test input:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nIn this line, from index 6 (value 8) to index 15 (value 8) is 10 consecutive 8s. So replace with 10 4s. The next part is at index 17: two 1s (less than 6), then index 21-25: five 1s (so no), then a 6. So only the 8s run is replaced.\n\nAnother test line: the fourth line of test input:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, the 8s start at index 6 and go to 15: that's 10 8s. Replace with 10 4s. Then, the 1s at index 20-26: seven 1s (positions 20-26?), so replace with seven 4s. Wait, wait, the line is [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]. The 8s from index 6 to 15 (positions 6-15 inclusive) is 10 elements. Then the 1s are from index 19 to 25 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) which is seven 1s. So those two runs would become 4s.\n\nAnother test line: the seventh line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nHere, the 8s start at index 6 (after 2,1) and run to index 16 (since the input shows eight 8s in the middle, but the actual count is let's see: positions 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8, which is 10 8s. Wait, the input line is [3,3,1,3,2,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,2,6,3,2,1,8,8,8,2,8]. Wait, from index 6 (value 8) to index 16 (value 8) is 11 8s? Let's count: positions 6-16: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. That's 11 consecutive 8s. So replace with 11 4s.\n\nSo the approach is to go through each list in the test input, check for consecutive runs of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each element in those runs with 4, while keeping the same length of the run. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, let's process each test input line.\n\nFirst line of test input:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6+ same numbers. Let's go through each element:\n\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 3,3,3: run of 3\n- 8: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: run of 2\n- 1: single\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 1,1,1: run of 3\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2,2: run of 2\n- 6: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8: single\n- 6: single.\n\nNo runs of 6 or more. So output is same as input.\n\nSecond test line:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 1: single\n- 6,6: 2\n- 8,8: 2\n- 1: single\n- 3,3: 2\n- 6: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8: 2\n- 2: single\n- 1,1: 2\n- 3: single\n- 6: single\n- 8,8: 2\n- 3: single\n- 1: single\n- 2: single\n- 1: single\n- 8: single\n- 2: single\n- 3: single\n- 8,8,8: 3\n- 2: single.\n\nNo runs of 6. So output same.\n\nThird test line:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs. The part starting at index 21: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s). So replace these six with 4s. So the output for this line would have 4s from index 21 to 26 (assuming 0-based). Let's confirm:\n\nOriginal: positions 21-26 (indices 20-25?) Let me check the list:\n\nIndices (assuming 0-based):\n\n0:8,1:8,2:3,3:6,4:3,5:1,6:6,7:8,8:3,9:8,10:6,11:3,12:1,13:2,14:8,15:1,16:8,17:2,18:1,19:3,20:2,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:8,28:3,29:6.\n\nWait, the list is:\n\n[8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nSo indices 21 to 26 are the elements 1,1,1,1,1,1. So six 1s. These become six 4s.\n\nSo the output for this line would have 4s from index 21 to 26.\n\nFourth test line:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck for runs. The part starting at index 20: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So replace with seven 4s. So indices 20-26 (seven elements) become 4s.\n\nFifth test line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nHere, the 8s run from index 6 (value 8) to index 15 (value 8). Let's count: positions 6-15 are 10 elements (8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8). So replace with ten 4s. Then, from index 19 (value 1) to index 25 (value 1): seven 1s. Replace with seven 4s.\n\nSo the output for this line would have 10 4s starting at index 6, and seven 4s starting at index 19.\n\nSixth test line:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nHere, the 8s run from index 6 to 15: ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s. Then the 1s at index 20-24: five 1s (less than 6). Then a 6, then 1s from index 21-25: wait, maybe I need to recount. Let's see:\n\nOriginal list: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nSo index 6 (element 8), 7-15: 8s. So indices 6-15: that's 10 elements (positions 6 to 15 inclusive). So replace with 4s. Then, after that, indices 20-24: 6,1,1,1,1,1 (index 20 is 6, then index 21 is 1, etc.) So from index 21 to 25: five 1s. Not replaced. The next part is index 26: 6. So no more runs of 6.\n\nSo the output for this line would have ten 4s starting at index 6.\n\nSeventh test line:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nFirst, the initial 3,3,3,3: four 3s. Then 8 at index 4, then 3 at index 5. Then from index 6 to 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8. Ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s. Then, after that, at index 23: 8s again from index 23 to 28: positions 23-28 (assuming the input is [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]. Wait, indices 23-28 would be 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). So replace with six 4s. So in this line, two runs: ten 8s replaced, and six 8s replaced.\n\nEighth test line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nThe 8s run from index 6 to 16: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (11 elements). Replace with 11 4s. Then, after that, at index 25: 8,8,8 (three 8s, so no replacement).\n\nNinth test line:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15: ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s. Then after that, 8s at indices 17-19: three 8s.\n\nTenth test line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 6, 6, 1, 3, 8, 3, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8, 1]\n\nThe 8s from index 6 to 15: ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s. Then 8s at indices 26-28: three 8s.\n\nEleventh test line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 3]\n\nThe 8s from index 5 to 14: ten 8s \u2192 ten 4s. Then 8s again at index 24 (single), and 1s at indices 25-27 (three 1s).\n\nTwelfth test line:\n\n[6, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 2, 8, 6, 2, 2, 2]\n\nNo runs of 6 or more.

The part from index 6: 8,8 (two), then later 2,2,2,2 (four), then 3,3,3 (three). All less than 6.\n\nFourteenth test line:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 6, 6, 8, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3]\n\nNo runs of 6+.\n\nFifteenth test line:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 6, 1, 1, 3]\n\nCheck runs. The 8,8,8 at the end (indices 18-20: three 8s). Then 3,3,3 (three). No runs of 6.\n\nSixteenth test line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6]\n\nNo runs of 6+.\n\nSeventeenth test line:\n\n[3, 8, 1, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 6, 3, 3, 1]\n\nCheck runs. The 8,8,8 at index 21-23 (three 8s). Then 6,6 at 14-15 (two). No runs of 6.\n\nEighteenth test line:\n\n[8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 3, 3, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 8, 1, 8, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 6, 1]\n\nNo runs of 6+.\n\nNineteenth test line:\n\n[3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 8]\n\nCheck runs.

The 3s from index 11-16: 3,3,3,3,6. Wait, the input line is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,8,2,8,8,1,2,8]. So starting at index 10 (3), then 3,3,3,3, then 6. So four 3s. Then after 6, there are 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) from index 16-21? Let me recount:\n\nIndices:\n\n10:3, 11:3, 12:3, 13:3, 14:6, 15:3, 16:3, 17:3, 18:3, 19:3, 20:3, 21:1. So the run starts at index 15: 3,3,3,3,3,3 (six 3s) from index 15-20. So replace with six 4s.\n\nTwenty-first test line:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 1, 1]\n\nCheck runs.

Replace with eight 4s.\n\nTwenty-seventh test line:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 8]\n\nCheck runs. The 3s from index 7-9: three 3s. The 3s from index 12-16: five 3s. No runs of 6. The 8,8 at 5-6. The 3s at 12-16 are five. So no replacement.\n\nTwenty-eighth test line:\n\n[6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3, 8]\n\nCheck runs. The 8,8,8,8 at index 8-11: four 8s.
