        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to look at the training examples and find out how the input lists are transformed into the output lists. Then apply that same pattern to the test input. Let's start by examining the first example.\n\nLooking at Example 0, the input and output arrays. Let's take the first input array and compare it to the output. They look the same. Wait, the first input array in Example 0's input is the same as the first array in the output. Same with the second array. Then starting from the third array in the input, the output changes. Let me check that.\n\nTake the third input array of Example 0:\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nHmm. I notice that in the input array, there are consecutive 8s starting from index 4 (positions 5 to 10, since Python is 0-based?), but in the output, those 8s are replaced with 4s. Similarly, the consecutive 2s starting at index 20 (positions 21 to 27) are replaced with 4s. So maybe whenever there's a run of the same number (like 8 or 2 here), it's replaced with 4s. But wait, how long does the run have to be? In the input, the first run of 8s is 6 elements (from index 4 to 9, six 8s), and they're replaced with six 4s. The 2s run from 20 to 26, which is 7 elements, replaced with seven 4s. So maybe any consecutive run of the same number longer than a certain length is replaced by 4s. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at the fourth input array in Example 0's input:\nInput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]\nOutput: [1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3]\n\nHere again, the run of six 8s starting at index 4 becomes six 4s. The run of seven 2s (indices 20-26) becomes seven 4s. But in the output, the last element of that 2s run is 2, but no, wait, the output shows the 7th element as 4. Wait, original input has 8 elements starting at index 20? Let's check again. Input array for the fourth example: positions 20-26 (indices 20 to 26 inclusive) are seven 2s. The output replaces them with seven 4s, but the next element (index 27) is 2 in the input and becomes 2 in the output. So the replacement is for exactly the consecutive elements of the same number. So any consecutive run of the same number is replaced by 4s? But how long is the run? Let's see.\n\nWait in the first example of Example 0, the runs are 6 and 7 elements long. In the output, both are replaced with 4s. Let's check another example where maybe the run is shorter. For example, in the first input array of Example 0, the first element is 3, followed by another 3. So two 3s. But in the output, they are left as 3s. So perhaps the replacement happens when the run is longer than a certain length, maybe 4 or more? Let's see.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. For instance, the third input array in Example 1's input is:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nHere, the run of nine 6s (indices 5 to 13) is replaced by nine 4s. But in the same input, there's a run of two 6s at indices 17 and 18 (values 6,6), which in the output remain 6s. So that suggests that runs of 2 are not replaced. So maybe the rule is that any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 4 or longer is replaced by 4s. Wait, let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, let's look at the 8th array:\n\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 8, 3, 1, 6, 3]\nOutput: same as input. So in this case, there's a run of two 1s (indices 23,24) in the input, but in the output, they remain as 1s. So runs of 2 are not replaced. So perhaps the rule is: replace any consecutive sequence of the same number that is 4 or more in length with 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nIn Example 0's input, the 12th input array:\n\nInput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 1]\nOutput: [8, 6, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n\nHere, the input has a run of six 3s starting at index 22 (values 3,3,3,3,3,3). These are replaced by 4s. So the run length is 6, which is >=4. The run of three 2s (indices 4-6) remains 2s. So the rule seems to be: replace any consecutive run of the same number that is 4 or longer with 4s. So the transformation is: for each element in the input array, if it is part of a consecutive sequence of the same number that is 4 or longer, replace each element in that sequence with 4. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nNow, to check if this applies to all examples. Let's take another example from Example 1. The first input array is the same as the output. The third input array, as we saw, has a run of 9 6s replaced by 4s. The 8th array in Example 1's input is:\n\nInput: [3, 8, 1, 6, 1, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 2, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 2, 2, 8, 6]\nOutput: same as input. Because there are runs of 3 (like three 3s in positions 22-24) which are left as is. So only runs of >=4 are replaced.\n\nSo the pattern is: for any consecutive sequence of the same number in the input list that has a length of 4 or more, replace each element in that sequence with the number 4. All other elements remain the same.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input. Let's process each array in the test input, looking for consecutive runs of the same number of length 4 or more and replacing them with 4s.\n\nLet's take the first test input array:\n\n[6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nLooking for runs of 4 or more. Let's check each element:\n\n- 6: single, no.\n- 8: single, no.\n- 3,3,3: three in a row. No, less than 4.\n- 8: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two, no.\n- 1: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 1,1,1: three, no.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2,2: two, no.\n- 6: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 6: single.\n\nNo runs of 4 or more here. So this array remains the same in the output.\n\nNext test input array:\n\n[1, 6, 6, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 8, 8, 2, 1, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 3, 1, 2, 1, 8, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 2]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n- 1: single.\n- 6,6: two, no.\n- 8,8: two, no.\n- 1: single.\n- 3,3: two, no.\n- 6: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8: two, no.\n- 2: single.\n- 1,1: two, no.\n- 3: single.\n- 6: single.\n- 8,8: two, no.\n- 3: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 1: single.\n- 8: single.\n- 2: single.\n- 3: single.\n- 8,8,8: three, no.\n- 2: single.\n\nNo runs of 4 here. So this array stays the same.\n\nThird test array:\n\n[8, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n- 8,8: two, no.\n- Then, later: 1,1,1,1,1,1 (six 1s) starting at index 20 (positions 21-26). This is a run of six 1s. So each of these six positions should be replaced with 4. The rest remain.\n\nSo the output for this array would have 4s in positions 21-26.\n\nSo the original input for this array has:\n\n..., 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, ... \n\nIn the output, that becomes:\n\n..., 2, 4,4,4,4,4,4, 8, ...\n\nFourth test array:\n\n[1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 1, 8, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 6, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nAt indices 7-9: 2,2,2 (three 2s). No. Then, later, starting at index 19 (if 0-based), looking at the array:\n\n..., 1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nThe array is:\n\nIndices 0-29:\n\n[1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n- 2,2,2 at indices 7-9: three 2s. No.\n\nAt indices 20-26 (assuming 0-based): values are 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 (seven 1s). So starting at index 20 (original elements from 20 to 26 inclusive), that's seven 1s. So replace with 4s. So positions 20-26 in the output will be 4s.\n\nSo the output array for this would have 4s in those positions.\n\nFifth test array:\n\n[8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nThe run of 8s starts at index 6 (value 8) and continues through index 15. Let's count: indices 6-15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (ten 8s). So that's a run of 10. Replace each with 4.\n\nThen, after that, there's a run of seven 1s at indices 20-26. So replace those with 4s.\n\nSo the output array would have 4s from index 6 to 15 and 20 to 26.\n\nSixth test array:\n\n[6, 1, 3, 1, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 3]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nFrom index 6 (value 8) to 15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nThen, indices 21-25: five 1s. Replace with 4s.\n\nSeventh test array:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nFirst four elements are 3,3,3,3: a run of four. Replace with 4s.\n\nThen, from index 5: 8, but index 5 is 3. Wait, the array is:\n\nIndices 0:3, 1:3, 2:3, 3:3, 4:8, 5:3, 6:8, 7-15: 8s. Wait, let me check again.\n\nOriginal array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nSo indices 0-3: four 3s. Replace with 4s.\n\nThen, indices 6-15: eight 8s (from index 6 to 15 inclusive). Replace with 4s.\n\nIndices 22-27: six 8s. Replace with 4s.\n\nEighth test array:\n\n[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 3, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nIndices 6-16: eight 8s followed by another 8 (index 16). So from index 6 to 16: 11 8s. Replace all with 4s.\n\nNinth test array:\n\n[1, 8, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nIndices 6-15: ten 8s. Replace with 4s.
