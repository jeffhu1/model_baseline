        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input lists into the output lists in the training examples. Then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at the first training example, Example 0. The input and output have the same length. Let me compare some of the input and output rows. For instance, the third input array in Example 0 is:\n\nInput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 8, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 2, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3]\n\nI notice that in the input, there's a sequence starting at index 4: 8,8,8,8,8,8 (six 8s). In the output, these are replaced by 4,4,4,4,4,4. Similarly, later in the input there are seven 2s starting at index 20, which become seven 4s in the output. So maybe sequences of the same number longer than a certain length are replaced by 4s. Let's check another example.\n\nTake the fourth input array in Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 3]\n\nOutput: [1, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 8, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 3]\n\nSame pattern here. The six 8s become 4s, and seven 2s become 4s. So the rule seems to be: replace consecutive runs of 6 or more of the same number with 4s. But let me check if it's exactly 6 or 6 or more.\n\nLooking at the first example's second input:\n\nInput: [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]\n\nOutput: [8, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 2, 6]\n\nHere, there are no sequences of 6, so the output is the same as the input. That aligns with the pattern. Another example: in Example 0's third input, there are six 8s and seven 2s replaced by 4s. So the rule is: consecutive runs of exactly 6 elements are replaced by 4s. Wait, but in some cases, maybe longer runs are also replaced. Let's see.\n\nTake the first input in Example 0's training data. The input is:\n\n[3, 3, 2, 6, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 3, 2, 8, 1, 1]\n\nThe output is the same as input. So in this case, there's a run of three 8s, then later five 3s, etc. So those aren't replaced. So the rule must be that any consecutive sequence of 6 or more of the same number is replaced with 4s for the length of that run.\n\nWait, in the third input in Example 0, the 8s are six in a row, so replaced by six 4s. The 2s are seven, replaced by seven 4s. So the length of the run is exactly 6 or more. So the pattern is: wherever there's a consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers, replace each element in that sequence with a 4. All other numbers remain the same.\n\nTesting this hypothesis against another example. Let's look at Example 1. For instance, the third input array:\n\nInput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nOutput: [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 8, 2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2]\n\nThe input has a run of nine 6s starting at index 5. The output replaces them all with 4s. That supports the rule.\n\nAnother example in Example 1: the 7th input array in the input:\n\nInput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nOutput: [8, 1, 3, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 3, 8, 2, 3, 6, 2, 8, 2]\n\nHere, there's a run of seven 8s starting at index 13. All are replaced by 4s. So yes, the rule holds.\n\nSo the pattern is: in each list, any consecutive sequence of 6 or more identical numbers is replaced with 4s for the length of that sequence. All other numbers are left unchanged.\n\nNow, apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nFirst array: [6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 1, 8, 3, 8, 8, 1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 8, 2, 3, 8, 6]\n\nCheck for consecutive runs of 6 or more. Let's go through each element:\n\n6, 8, 3,3,3,8,1,8,3,8,8,1,... etc. The longest runs here are three 3s (indices 2-4), two 8s (indices 9-10), etc. So no runs of 6. So output is same as input.\n\nSecond array: [1,6,6,8,8,1,3,3,6,3,8,8,2,1,1,3,6,8,8,3,1,2,1,8,2,3,8,8,8,2]\n\nCheck runs: 6,6 (indices 1-2: two 6s), 8,8 (indices 3-4), 3,3 (indices 6-7), 8,8 (indices 10-11), 1,1 (indices 13-14), 8,8 (indices 17-18), 8,8,8 (indices 26-28: three 8s). No runs of 6. So output same.\n\nThird array: [8,8,3,6,3,1,6,8,3,8,6,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6]\n\nLooking for runs of 6. At indices 21-26: six 1s. So replace with six 4s. The elements from index 21 to 26 (inclusive) are 1,1,1,1,1,1. So in the output, these become 4,4,4,4,4,4. The rest remains the same.\n\nFourth array: [1,3,1,2,8,1,8,2,2,2,1,3,1,8,3,6,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,6,3]\n\nLooking for runs of 6 or more. From index 20 to 26: seven 1s. So replace with seven 4s. So elements 20-26 (1s) become 4s.\n\nFifth array: [8,1,2,3,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,3,6,8]\n\nLooking for runs. From index 6 to 15: the number is 8, repeated 10 times. So replace all ten 8s with 4s. Then, from index 19-25: seven 1s. Replace those with 4s. So in the output, positions 6-15 become 4s, and 19-25 become 4s.\n\nSixth array: [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]\n\nHere, the 8s start at index 6 and run for 10 elements. So replace those with 4s. Then, from index 22-26: five 1s (not enough). Wait, index 22-26: 1,1,1,1,1 (five). So no. Wait, the input is [6,1,3,1,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,2,8,3]. The 8s start at index 6 (element 8) and go to index 15: that's 10 elements. So replace those 10 with 4s. Then the 1s at indices 20-24 (five elements) are not enough. The 1s at 16-17 are two. So output for this array would have 10 4s starting at index 6.\n\nSeventh array: [3,3,3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,1,1,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3]\n\nWait, let's check the test input's seventh array:\n\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 3]\n\nLooking for runs. The 8s start at index 6 (element 8) and run to index 15: that's 10 8s. Replace with 4s. Then, the 8s at index 22-27: six 8s. Replace those with 4s. So positions 6-15 and 22-27 become 4s.\n\nContinuing this way for each array in the test input, wherever there's a consecutive run of 6 or more same numbers, replace with 4s.\n\nNow, applying this to each array in the test input and generating the output accordingly."
